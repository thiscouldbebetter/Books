NOTE A.
-------

_See Introduction, page xxxii. note 1_.

'Oh ye mighty and pompous lords, shining in the glory transitory of
this unstable life, as in reigning over realms great, and mighty
countries, fortified with strong castles and towers, edified with many
a rich city. Ye also, ye fierce and mighty chivalers, so valiant in
adventurous deeds of arms, behold, behold, see how this mighty
conqueror Arthur, whom in his human life all the world doubted--ye
also, the noble queen Guenever, that sometime sat in her chair adorned
with gold, pearls, and precious stones, now lie full low in obscure
foss or pit covered with clods of earth and clay. Behold also this
mighty champion Launcelot, peerless of knighthood, see now how he lieth
groveling on the cold mould, now being so feeble and faint that
sometime was so terrible, how and in what manner ought ye to be so
desirous of the mundane honour so dangerous. Therefore me thinketh this
present book called La Morte Darthur is right necessary often to be
read, for in it shall ye find the gracious, knightly, and virtuous war
of most noble knights of the world, whereby they gat praising
continual. Also me seemeth by the oft reading thereof ye shall greatly
desire to accustom yourself in following of those gracious knightly
deeds, that is to say, to dread God, and to love rightwiseness,
faithfully and courageously to serve your sovereign prince. And the
more that God hath given you the triumphal honour the meeker ye ought
to be, ever fearing the unstableness of this deceivable world. And so I
pass over, and turn again to my matter.'


NOTE B.
-------

_See Introduction, page xxxiv. note 3._

For those who may care to see more of the manner in which the text of
the interpolated passages has been formed, I give the following
specimens in detail.

The first is from the beginning of the 11th Chapter of Book XXI.


> CAXTON.
>

> UPCOTT.
> 
> 'Than syr Launcelot rose vp or it was day, and tolde the heremyte
> therof. It were well done sayd the heremyte that ye made you redy,
> and that ye dysobeye not thys aduysyon. The[=n]e syr Launcelot toke

> cometh as faste as he may for to fetche my corps. And besyde my
> lorde kynge Arthur he shal burye me.'

The last lines of the same Chapter are as follows:--


> CAXTON.
> 
> 'For whan I remembre of hir beaulte and of hir noblesse that was
> bothe with hyr king & with hyr/So whan I sawe his corps and hir
> corps so lye togyders/truly myn herte wold not serue to susteyne my

> so to myn herte that I miȝt not susteyne myself so the frensshe
> book maketh mencyon.'


> UPCOTT.
> 
> (Who follows Wynkyn de Worde exactly, except in the spelling, and in
> the insertion of 'me' after 'wold not serue.')
> 
> 'For whan I remembre _& calle to mynde_ her beaute, _bountee &_
> noblesse, that was _as wel_ wyth her kyng _my lord Arthur_ as wyth
> her. _And also_ whanne I saw _the corses of that noble kinge &

> natural strengthe fayled me, so that_ I myghte not susteyne my
> selfe. Soo the frensshe boke makyth mencyon.'

The several colophons are as follows:--


> CAXTON.
> 
> 'Thus endeth thys noble and Ioyous book entytled le morte
> Darthur/Notwithstondyng it treateth of the byrth/lyf/and actes of

On a comparison of these colophons we see that the article _La_ is only
in Ames: the spelling of _dathur_ is peculiar to Wynkyn de Worde, who
has it also in another passage; the words _le Morte darthur with_ are
in the Harleian Catalogue only: _as afore is said_ is in neither of
these, but it is in Ames: the peculiar mode of writing _Sang real_[47],
and the spelling of _chaptyred_, _emprynted_, _July_, are those of the
Harleian Catalogue: the _&_ introduced after _Arthur_ in the second
line is only in Upcott. _Caxton me fieri fecit_ is in Ames, but not in
the Harleian Catalogue.

When I say in Ames or the Harleian Catalogue only, it will be
understood that I include with the colophon of the former its
modernised copy in Dibdin; and with that of the latter its copies in
Herbert and the Biographia Britannica; the references to all which I
have given in the passage of the Introduction to which this is a Note.
The first words of the colophon are omitted in the Harleian Catalogue,
which gives it as the title of the book, as do the Biographia
Britannica and Herbert. The framer of the Catalogue probably quotes
directly, though inaccurately, from the Harleian (now the Osterley)
Morte Darthur: and Ames must have made his extract independently from
the same volume. Dibdin attributes both the Harleian Catalogue and the
article in the Biographia Britannica to Oldys.

Gervase of Tilbury wrote about the beginning of the thirteenth
century. He was at the Peace of Venice in 1177 A. D.; was Chancellor
and Marshall of the kingdom of Arles about the year 1200; and died in
1235.

Footnote 11:

The passage, which also recounts the names of Ewaine, Gawaine, and
Launcelot du Lac, is found in a charming episode in 'The Complaynt of
Scotland' (written in 1548, and edited in 1801 by G. J. Leyden), in
which the author tells how he went into the country to refresh his
weary mind and body, and there fell in with a party of shepherds and
shepherds' wives and servants, who amused themselves with telling a
number of stories, classical and romantic, of which he gives the
names. It is a prose idyll, which reminds us of the Canterbury Tales,
and the Vision of Piers Plowman, in the love of nature and the love
of story-telling which it displays. Here, and in the passage from
Gervase, I quote from the originals; but my attention was first
directed to these by Sir George Webb Dasent's quotations in his
'Popular Tales from the Norse,' p. xxix.

It is curious to note that Milton with all his learning should, like
Malory and Caxton, have spoken of the Britons as English, and the
Saxons as foreigners--a popular misuse of names which still makes the
Lowland Scotch complain if they are called English instead of
British, though they are in fact more English than the English in
language and in blood.

availed myself of--are Mills's History of Chivalry, which alone
almost exhausts the subject; Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire; Godwin's Life of Chaucer; Scott's Essay on Chivalry; Lord
Berner's Froissart; and Southey's Introduction to Amadis of Gaul.


Footnote 47:
------------

The division of the word indicates that the writer adopts the
plausible notion that Sangreal means Real (or Royal) Blood; and no
doubt in ancient as well as modern times the spelling and sound would
suggest this meaning: but Roquefort shows clearly that the other is
the proper explanation, both in etymology and (so to speak)
historically. And Helinand, a monk of Fromont (A.D. 717), gives the
Latin _Gradale_, which supplies the link between _Graal_ and _Crater_
from which Roquefort derives the former. Helinand's words are,--'Hoc
tempore, in Britannia, cuidam eremitae monstrata est mirabilis
quaedam visio per angelum de sancto Josepho decurione nobili qui
corpus Domini deposuit de cruce, et de catino illo vel paropside in
quo Dominus coenavit cum discipulis suis; de qua ab eodem eremita
descripta est historia quae dicitur _de Gradal_. _Gradalis_ autem vel
_Gradale_ dicitur Gallicè scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda in
qua pretiosae dapes, cum suo jure, divitibus solent apponi, et
dicitur nomine _Graal_.... Hanc historiam latine scriptam invenire
non potui, sed tantum Gallicè scripta habetur a quibusdam proceribus,
nec facile ut aiunt tota inveniri potest.' Helinandi Historia, quoted
in L'Essai Historique et Literaire sur l'Abbaye de Fécamp par Leroux
de Lincy, Rouen, 1840.
