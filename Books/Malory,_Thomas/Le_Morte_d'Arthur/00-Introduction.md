The Introduction to the first edition of this volume included an
account of the Text in the various editions of Sir Thomas Malory's
'Morte Darthur,' and an attempt to estimate the character and worth of
his book. The publication of Dr. Sommer's edition of the Text and
Prolegomena, demands that I should complete my bibliography by an
account of this important work; and it enables me, by help of this
learned writer's new information, to confirm, while enlarging, my
former criticism. I have, therefore, revised and re-written the two
first sections of the Introduction. The Essay on Chivalry remains, but
for a few verbal changes, as it was first printed.

1. THE AUTHORSHIP AND MATTER OF THE BOOK.
-----------------------------------------

ORIGIN OF THE BOOK.
-------------------

We owe this our English Epic of Le Morte Darthur to Sir Thomas Malory,
and to William Caxton the first English printer. Caxton's Preface shows
(what indeed would have been certain from his appeal to the 'Knights of
England' at the end of 'The Order of Chivalry') that however strongly
he, 'William Caxton, simple person,' may have been urged to undertake
the work by 'divers gentlemen of this realm of England,' he was not
less moved by his own love and reverence for 'the noble acts of
chivalry,' and his deep sense of his duty and responsibility in
printing what he believed would be for the instruction and profit of
his readers, 'of whatever estate or degree.' But to Sir Thomas Malory
he gives all the honour of having provided him with the copy which he
printed. And ever since, for more than four hundred years, successive
generations have approved the fitness of Caxton's choice. For it is
Malory's book, and not the older forms of King Arthur's story which we
still read for enjoyment, and for the illustration of which scholars
edit those earlier books. Only a true poem, the offspring of genius,
could have so held, and be still holding its ground, age after age. It
may be said that it is chiefly with boys, and with men who have formed
the taste by their boyish reading, that the book is so popular. But is
not this so with the Iliad too? Men of mature intellect and taste read
and re-read the Iliad with ever new discoveries, appreciation, and
enjoyment; but it may be questioned whether there are many, or even
any, of them who did not begin those studies at school, and learn to
love Homer before they knew that he was worthy of their love. And they
who have given most of such reading, in youth and in manhood, to
Malory's Morte Darthur will be the most able and ready to recognise its
claim to the character of an Epic poem.


MALORY A POET.
--------------

Malory wrote in prose, but he had 'the vision and the faculty divine'
of the poet, though 'wanting the accomplishment of verse'; and, great
as that want is, we may apply Milton's test of 'simple, sensuous, and
passionate,' and we shall find no right to these names more real than
is Malory's. Every incident, the description of every event, is
'simple,' that is to say, complete in itself, while making a part of
the whole story. The story is 'sensuous,' like that of Homer, and as
every true poem must be, it is a living succession of concrete images
and pictures, not of abstractions or generalized arguments and
reasonings. These are the characteristics of the book, from its opening
story of Igraine, which 'befell in the days of Uther Pendragon,' down
to the death of the last four remaining knights who 'went into the Holy
Land, there as Jesus Christ was quick and dead,' and there 'did many
battles upon the miscreants or Turks, and there they died on a Good
Friday for God's sake.' And for 'passion,' for that emotion which the
poet first feels in a special manner, and then awakens in his hearers,
though they could not have originated it in themselves, with the
adventures of the Round Table and the San Greal, or the deaths of
Arthur, of Guenever, and of Launcelot, we may compare the wrath of
Achilles, its cause and its consequences, or the leave-taking of Hector
and Andromache. It would, indeed, be hard to find anywhere a pathos
greater than that of Malory's description of the death or 'passing' of
Arthur, the penitence of Guenever, and her parting with Launcelot, or
the lament of Launcelot over the King and Queen, and of Sir Ector over
Launcelot himself. The first is too long to quote, but I may say that
Malory has re-cast the old story, and all the poetry is his own. I give
the two last:--

> 'Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I trust I do not displease God, for He
> knoweth mine intent, for my sorrow was not, nor is not, for any
> rejoicing of sin, but my sorrow may never have end. For when I
> remember of her beauty, and of her noblesse, that was both with her
> king and with her; so when I saw his corpse and her corpse so lie
> together, truly mine heart would not serve to sustain my careful
> body. Also when I remember me, how by my default, mine orgule, and
> my pride, that they were both laid full low, that were peerless
> that ever was living of christian people, wit you well, said Sir
> Launcelot, this remembered, of their kindness and mine unkindness,
> sank so to my heart, that I might not sustain myself.'

And again:--

> 'Ah, Launcelot, he said, thou were head of all christian knights;
> and now I dare say, said Sir Ector, thou Sir Launcelot, there thou
> liest, that thou were never matched of earthly knight's hand; and
> thou were the courtiest knight that ever bare shield; and thou were
> the truest friend to thy lover that ever bestrode horse; and thou
> were the truest lover of a sinful man that ever loved woman; and
> thou were the kindest man that ever strake with sword; and thou
> were the goodliest person ever came among press of knights; and
> thou was the meekest man and the gentlest that ever ate in hall
> among ladies; and thou were the sternest knight to thy mortal foe
> that ever put spear in the rest[1].'

The former passage is all Malory's own: the beauty of the latter is
enhanced, if we set by its side the old version which he follows:--

> 'Alas, sir [said] Bors, that I was born,
> That ever I should see this indeed,
> The beste knight his life hath lorn,
> That ever in stoure [fight] bestrode a steed,
> Jesu, that crowned was with thorn,
> In heaven his soul foster and feed[2].'

Humour is akin to passion; and it may not be out of place to notice
here Malory's vein of humour, as shown, for instance, in the way in
which he tells the adventures of La Cote Male Taile, and of Beaumains;
the pranks of the braver knights with Dinadan and Dagonet; the story of
Arthur's wedding feast, when a lady who 'cried and made great dole,'
was forcibly carried out of the hall by a strange knight, and Arthur
'was glad, for she made such a noise,' and was thereupon rebuked by
Merlin for thinking so lightly of his royal and knightly duties; or
that of the usurper Mordred and the Bishop of Canterbury, when after
each had defied the other, the bishop 'did the curse in the most
orgulous wise that might be done,' and then retired to live 'in poverty
and holy prayers, for well he understood that mischievous war was at
hand.'


THE BOOK EPIC IN PLAN.
----------------------

In the Drama the action is present, actually unwinding itself and going
on before our eyes. The Epic is the story of the past, a cycle of
events completed, while through the one and the other may be traced a
thread of destiny and providence, leading either to a happy triumph
over circumstances, or to a tragic doom, which, too, is in the end, a
triumph also. Thomas Hughes, the early Elizabethan dramatist, in his
'Misfortunes of Arthur,' concentrated and deepened the horror of such a
tragedy by transferring the guilt of Launcelot to Mordred the son of
Arthur and his unknown sister. He would better have recognised and
followed the finer art of Malory. For though the motive of Malory's
epic is less gross and exaggerated than that of Hughes's drama, the
thread of guilt and doom which runs from first to last through the
former is not less real than in the latter. The crime of Uther
Pendragon, with which the story opens, leads to the concealment of
Arthur's parentage from himself, and this to his illicit love for her
whom he does not know to be his sister, and so to the birth of Mordred.
Then comes the prophetic doom:--'Ye have done of late a thing that God
is displeased with you: and your sister shall have a child that shall
destroy you and all the knights of your realm.' Arthur tries in vain to
prevent the fulfilment of this doom by the only cruel deed of his life:
and then--after another warning of the woe which his marriage with
Guinevere will bring on him, through her guilty love for
Launcelot--these germs of tragic destiny remain hidden through long
years of prosperity. Arthur, aided by his fellowship of the Round
Table, reduces universal anarchy into order: and not only 'gets into
his hand' all England, Wales, and Scotland, but by his march to Rome
makes himself emperor, and the head of all the kingdoms as well as of
all the chivalry of Christendom. Still the fame and the honour of the
king and his knights of the Round Table open continually into new and
brighter forms, which seem above the reach of any adverse fate, till
the coming of the Sancgreal, into the quest of which all the knights
enter with that self-reliance which had become them so well in the
field of worldly chivalry, but which would be of no avail now. They are
now to be tried by other tests than those by which they had been proved
as 'earthly knights and lovers,' tests which even Launcelot, Ector de
Maris, Gawaine, and the other chiefest of the fellowship could not
stand. The quest is achieved by the holy knights alone: two depart from
this life to a higher, while Sir Bors, not quite spotless, yet forgiven
and sanctified, the link between the earthly and the spiritual worlds,
returns to aid in restoring the glory of the feasts and tournaments at
Camelot and Westminster. But the curse is at work: the severance
between good and evil which had been declared through the Sancgreal
cannot be closed again; and the tragic end comes on, in spite of the
efforts--touching from their very weakness--of Arthur and Launcelot to
avert the woe, the one by vainly trying to resist temptation, the other
by refusing to believe evil of his wife and his dearest friend. The
black clouds open for a moment as the sun goes down; and we see Arthur
in the barge which bears him to the Holy Isle; Guenever, the nun of
Almesbury, living in fasting, prayers, and almsdeeds; and Launcelot
with his fellowship, once knights but now hermit-priests, 'doing bodily
all manner of service.'

Nor are the marks of harmony and unity less plain in the several
characters than in the events of the story. Arthur is a true knight,
sharing the characteristics of his nobler knights, yet he differs from
them all in showing also that he is, and feels himself to be, a king;
as when--with an imperiousness which reminds us of Froissart's story of
Edward III refusing to listen to Sir Walter of Manny's remonstrances on
behalf of the burgesses of Calais--he tells Sir Launcelot that he
'takes no force whom he grieves,' or insists on his entering the lists
against a tired knight whom he is not willing to see victorious over
the whole field; or as when he sadly regrets that he cannot do battle
for his wife, though he believes her innocent, but must be a rightful
judge according to the laws. There are many others of the Round Table
who are 'very perfect gentle knights, yet we feel that Launcelot stands
distinct among them all in the pre-eminence of his knightliness,
notwithstanding his one great sin. Thus, to take one of many instances,
who but Launcelot would have borne the taunts and the violence of
Gawaine with his humble patience and ever-renewed efforts for a
reconciliation, when he was leaving the realm, and when he was besieged
in Joyous Gard. Modern critics of great name agree in censuring Sir
Thomas Malory for departing from the old authorities who represented
Gawaine as the very counterpart of Launcelot in knightly character: but
I rather see a proof of Malory's art in giving us a new Gawaine with a
strongly individual character of his own. Gawaine's regard for his
mother's honour, his passion for Ettard, and his affection for his
brothers, are fierce impulses driving him to unknightly and unworthy
deeds, yet he is far from being represented as a mere savage. If Malory
depicts him thirsting to revenge upon Launcelot the unintentional
killing of Gaheris and Gareth, he depicts also his long previous
affection for Launcelot and his opposition to the hostility of his
other brother, Mordred, against him; his devotion to his uncle Arthur;
his hearty repentance towards Launcelot at the last; and his entreaty
that he would 'see his tomb, and pray some prayer more or less for his
soul.' Nor must we forget that it was by the prayer of those ladies for
whom Gawaine had 'done battle in a rightwise quarrel,' that his ghost
was permitted to give Arthur a last warning. Distinct again from the
character of this fierce knight is that of the Saracen Palamides, whose
unquestionable courage and skill in deeds of chivalry also want--though
in another way than Gawaine's--the gentleness, the meekness, and the
delicate sense of honour of the Christian knight. Sir Dinadan again,
who can give and take hard knocks if need be, though he has no great
bodily strength, and who is always bantering the good knights who know
and esteem him with his humorous protests against love and arms, is a
distinctly drawn character. So is Merlin, half Christian, half
magician, but always with dog-like loyalty to the house of Uther
Pendragon. So is the Bishop of Canterbury, who appears at intervals in
the story. So are many others whose names I might recite. The dignity
of queen Guenever towards her husband and her court is not less marked
than her guilty passion for Launcelot, and the unreasoning jealousy it
excites in her. The wife-like simplicity of Igraine, the self-surrender
beyond all limit, though from different impulses, of the two Elaines,
the pertness of the damsel Linet, and the piety and self-sacrifice of
Sir Percivale's sister, will occur to the reader among the distinctive
characteristics of the different ladies and damsels who live and move,
each in her own proper form, in the story. Sir Thomas Malory, as we
know, found many of these men and women already existing in the old
romances as he represents them to us; but we may believe that those
earlier books were to him something of what the pages of Plutarch and
Holinshed were to Shakespeare.


MALORY'S USE OF THE OLD ROMANCES.
---------------------------------

It has been too commonly assumed that, because Caxton says that Sir
Thomas Malory took his work 'out of certain books of French and reduced
it into English,' he was a mere compiler and translator. But the book
itself shows that he was its author--its 'maker,' as he would have
called it. Notwithstanding his occasionally inartificial manner of
connecting the materials drawn from the old romances, there is an epic
unity and harmony, 'a beginning, a middle, and an end,' which, if they
have come by chance and not of design, have come by that chance which
only befalls an Homeric or a Shakespeare-like man. If more instances
and proofs are needed than have been already given, let us turn to the
opening chapters of the book. If we compare these with the old romances
which supplied the materials for them, we see at once how Malory has
converted prose into poetry, giving life and beauty to the clods of
earth, and transmuting by his art the legends which he yet faithfully
preserves. For the long and repulsive narrative of Merlin's origin[3]
he substitutes a slight allusion to it: without disguising what he
probably believed to be at least an half historical record of Arthur's
birth, he gives a grace and dignity to the story by the charms of the
mother's character, the finer touches of which are wanting in the
original: and so through the whole of this part of the story.

Twenty-three years ago, I ventured to assert Malory's claim to epic
genius: and now this claim may be farther tested, and as I think,
established, by help of the learned researches of Dr. Sommer. Of these
I shall state some details, in speaking of the text and its several
editions, here giving the result so far as it bears on the present
point. We may now see how Malory's 'Morte Darthur' was fused into its
actual form out of crude materials of ten times its bulk, and that
while he often translated or transcribed the French or English romances
as they lay before him, on the other hand he not only re-wrote, in
order to bring into its present shape the whole story, but also varied
both the order and the substance of the incidents that so he might give
them that epic character, and that beauty in the details, which his
book shows throughout. Malory was no doubt a 'finder' as well as a
'maker,' but so, I repeat, was Shakespeare, and so was every other
great poet. But the quarry and the building are not the same thing,
though the one supplies the rough stones with which the other is raised
up. We see that there is much that is rude and inartificial in Malory's
art. He has built a great, rambling, mediæval castle, the walls of
which enclose rude and even ruinous work of earlier times, and not a
Greek Parthenon nor even an Italian palace of the Renaissance. Still,
it is a grand pile, and tells everywhere of the genius of its builder.
And I ask, as Carlyle once asked me, Who built St. Paul's? Was it Wren,
or the hodman who carried up the bricks? But while supporting my
conclusions as to Malory's art by the evidence of Dr. Sommer's facts,
it is right to add that the conclusions are my own rather than those of
this learned critic. His estimate of Malory's genius in the choice and
treatment of his materials falls far short of mine: and I can believe
that Malory may have judged rightly, for his own purpose, when he did
not take that form of a legend which was in itself the most beautiful.


MALORY'S HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY.
-------------------------------

The most recent critics are disposed to prefer Hume's and Gibbon's
belief to Milton's scepticism as to the actual existence of Arthur. But
upon this question I do not enter. Malory's historical chapters, as
they may be called, seem to be mainly taken from the _Historia
Brithonum_ of Geoffrey of Monmouth, though much of them is also to be
found in the romances[4]. The details of Arthur's march to Rome are so
accurate that I think that Malory may have had actual knowledge of the
road, which indeed must have been familiar to many men--soldiers,
priests, and merchants--in the days of Edward IV. But of the rest of
the history and the geography of the book before us we can only say
that they are something

> 'Apart from place, withholding time,
> But flattering the golden prime'

of the great hero of English romance. We cannot bring within any limits
of history the events which here succeed each other, when the Lords and
Commons of England, after the death of King Uther at St. Alban's,
assembled at the greatest church of London, guided by the joint policy
of the magician Merlin and the Christian bishop of Canterbury, and
elected Arthur to the throne; when Arthur made Carlion, or Camelot, or
both, his head-quarters in a war against Cornwall, Wales, and the
North, in which he was victorious by help of the king of France; when
he met the demand for tribute by the Roman emperor Lucius with a
counter-claim to the empire for himself as the real representative of
Constantine, held a parliament at York to make the necessary
arrangements, crossed the sea from Sandwich to Barflete in Flanders,
met the united forces of the Romans and Saracens in Burgundy, slew the
emperor in a great battle, together with his allies, the Sowdan of
Syria, the king of Egypt, and the king of Ethiopia, sent their bodies
to the Senate and Podestà of Rome as the only tribute he would pay, and
then followed over the mountains through Lombardy and Tuscany to Rome,
where he was crowned emperor by the Pope, 'sojourned there a time,
established all his lands from Rome unto France, and gave lands and
realms unto his servants and knights,' and so returned home to England,
where he seems thenceforth to have devoted himself wholly to his duties
as the head of Christian knighthood.

With the exception just mentioned, the geography is fanciful enough;
and we need the magic of Merlin, or of some conjuror-poet like him of
Horace, to set us with the required disregard of time successively in
Carleon, Carlisle, Winchester, London, St. Alban's, and Camelot. The
story opens within a night's ride of the castle of Tintagil. Thence we
pass to St. Alban's, to London, and to Carlion. This last is, no doubt,
Caerleon-upon-Usk; but it seems through this, as in other romances, to
be interchangeable in the author's mind with Carlisle, or (as written
in its Anglo-Norman form) Cardoile, which latter in the History of
Merlin is said to be in Wales, while elsewhere Wales and Cumberland are
confounded in like manner. So of Camelot, where Arthur chiefly held his
court, Caxton in his Preface speaks as though it were in Wales,
probably meaning Caerleon, where the Roman amphitheatre is still called
Arthur's Round Table. Malory himself, though at page 49 he seems to
connect Camelot with Avelion, or Glastonbury, yet farther on, page 63,
says that Camelot is Winchester, where, too, there is a Round Table,
mentioned by Caxton, and still to be seen,--an oaken board with the
knights' names on it. And yet at the time these authorities wrote
Camelot itself existed in Somersetshire with its proper name, and with
all the remains of an important town and fortress, and, doubtless, the
traditions of Arthur which Leland found there, and which in great part
at least remain to this day. Leland calls it Camallate or Camalat,
'sometime a famous town or castle, upon a very torre or hill,
wonderfully enstrengthened of nature[5].' Four ditches and as many
walls surrounded a central space of about thirty acres where
foundations and remains of walls might be seen, and whence Roman
pavements, urns, coins, and other relics have been found up to the
present time. I find it called the Castle of Camellek in maps of the
dates of 1575 and 1610, and in that of the 1727 edition of Camden's
Magna Britannica, the text of which says 'the inhabitants call it King
Arthur's Palace.' But soon after that date a learned antiquarian[6]
writes that the name had been superseded by that of Cadbury Castle,
which trilingual appellation may seem to indicate the Roman, British,
and Saxon possessors by whom it was probably held in succession. The
neighbouring villages which, according to Leland, bore 'the name of
Camalat with an addition, as Queen-Camel,' still exist as Queen-Camel,
or East Camel, and West Camel, and near by runs the river Camel,
crossed by Arthur's Bridge. Arthur's well still springs from the hill
side; and if Arthur's Hunting Causeway in the field below, Arthur's
Round Table and Arthur's Palace within the camp, cannot still, as of
old, be pointed out to the visitor, the peasant girl will still tell
him that within that charmed circle they who look may see through
golden gates a king sitting in the midst of his court. Drayton
describes the river Ivel in Somersetshire as

> 'The nearest neighbouring flood to Arthur's ancient seat,
> Which made the Britaines name thro' all the world so great.
> Like Camelot what place was ever yet renown'd?
> Where, as at Caerleon, oft he kept the Table Round,
> Most famous for the sports at Pentecost so long,
> From whence all knightly deeds and brave atchievements sprong[7].'

These old legendary traditions, pleasant to hear or to know of, have
been collected by another Somersetshire antiquarian, the late Rev. J.
H. Bennett, Rector of South Cadbury[8]. Together with the legends told
by Leland and others, and those which he himself gathered on the spot,
Mr. Bennett has given a carefully detailed topographical description of
the old town and fortress of Camelot, strong by nature and strengthened
by art, where the Britons made their last stand against the Saxons; and
he has shewn how its strategical position was connected, in fact as
well as in romance, with the Isle of Avallon, the Monastery of
Glastonbury, and the Nunnery of Almesbury. He thinks that during the
hundred years which followed the taking of Sarum by the Saxons A. D.
551, during which (except in the capture of Bath in 577 A. D.) they
made no further progress in the conquest of Somersetshire, Camelot
became the capital of the South British kingdoms, and stemmed the tide
of war in this direction by its great line of strongholds; and he thus
suggests that we may have here the historical circumstances which
connected or helped to connect, the legends of the great British hero
with Camelot. Leland, who wrote his _Itinerary_ early in Henry VIII's
reign, mentions, among other relics found at Camelot, a silver
horseshoe, and Mr. Bennett gives us the words of one of the Cadbury
peasants who told him 'folks do say that on the night of the full moon
King Arthur and his men ride round the hill, and their horses are shod
with silver, and a silver shoe has been found in the track where they
do ride, and when they have ridden round the hill they stop to water
their horses at the wishing well.' But more than three hundred years
before Leland wrote, this still living legend had been recorded by
Gervase of Tilbury, who, in his _Otia Imperialia_ (date about 1212)
says that in the woods of Britain the foresters, as the common people
call the keepers of the woods and wild game, tell that on alternate
days, about noon, or at midnight when the moon is full and shining,
they often see an array of hunters with dogs and sound of horns, who,
in answer to the enquirers, say that they are of the household and
fellowship of Arthur. And, what is still more curious, Gervase, in the
same place, gives a legend of Arthur, of Mount Etna, which singularly
corresponds with that just mentioned as still living among the mounds
of ancient Camelot. He tells that the horse of the Bishop of Catania
had run away from his groom, and when the groom was following him up
the precipitous side of the mountain, he came upon an open place where
was the Great Arthur, resting upon a couch. Arthur ordered the horse to
be brought back and restored to the bishop, sent him presents, and
related how he had lain there, all those years, suffering from wounds
he had received in the battle with his nephew Mordred, and Childeric
the leader of the Saxons[9]. The British story of Arthur and the
Knights of the Round Table had spread through Italy by the side of the
French romances of Roland and Charlemagne[10] but this curious transfer
of an incident from Camelot in Somersetshire, to Mount Etna in Sicily
seems as if it must have been due to some Norman troubadour who had
actually passed from one land to the other, and given the proper local
colouring to the story in its new home as the bee carries fertility
from one garden to another. Scotland, too, among the stories by which
she claimed her part in Arthur and his knights, had a tale how 'Arthour
Knycht he raid on nycht with gylten spur and candel lycht[11].'

Legend tells that Glastonbury--founded by Joseph of Arimathea, and his
burial-place, though his body was vainly sought in Edward III's
reign--possesses the coffin of Arthur. It is said that Henry II found
the bodies of Arthur and Guenever there, and that Guenever had yellow
hair. Their skulls were afterwards taken for relics by Edward
Longshanks and Eleanor.

Almesbury, where Guenever died a nun, is a town in Wiltshire, seven and
a half miles from Salisbury, where may still be seen the ruins of its
celebrated abbey. The name was originally Ambrosebury, then Ambresbury,
and lastly Amesbury, as it is now spelt.

The ruins of the castle of Tintagil, too, may still be seen in Cornwall.

Joyous Gard, Launcelot's favourite castle, is sometimes identified with
Berwick. Malory tells us that 'some men say it was Anwick, and some men
say it was Bamborow.' Bamborow, or Bamborough, is in Northumberland,
sixteen miles southeast of Berwick. The castle, founded in the middle
of the sixth century, which is the supposed time of Arthur's reign,
stands on a high rock projecting into the North Sea. It now contains a
granary, hospital, and other endowments made for the poor in 1715 by
Lord Crewe, bishop of Durham. Did he think of his predecessor
Launcelot, and his doles of 'flesh, fish, wine and ale, and twelve
pence to any man and woman, come who would?'

The names of some other places in this book are given in the Glossary.


THE SANGREAL.
-------------

Let us turn to the Sangreal, or Holy Grail, the Quest of which forms so
important a part of Malory's book. The word 'Grail' means a dish, a
drinking vessel, or a tureen, in the Romance language, and is probably
derived from the Low Latin 'gradalis' or 'grasalis'; and this from the
Greek 'crater': and the old writers describe it sometimes as a shallow
vessel for holding food, and sometimes as a cup[12]. The legend of the
Grail is traced back to Pagan times, where it appears as a miraculously
food-producing vessel, of which we perhaps see a survival in the coming
of the Sangreal to Launcelot and King Pelles, and at the feast of
Pentecost which led to the Quest:--

'Then there entered into the hall the holy Grail covered with white
samite, but there was none might see it, nor who bare it. And there was
all the hall full filled with good odours, and every knight had such
meats and drinks as he best loved in this world: and when the holy
Grail had been borne through the hall, then the holy vessel departed
suddenly, that they wist not where it became.'

But in the Christian form into which the legend passed, the Grail
became either the dish which held the paschal lamb at the Last Supper,
the vessel in which Joseph of Arimathea had received the Saviour's
blood, or the sacramental cup itself. Mr. Alfred Nutt has treated the
whole subject with exhaustive learning in his 'Studies of the Legend of
the Holy Grail,' and his article 'Grail, the Holy' in Chambers'
Encyclopaedia. But when I say that one only of the many stories of
which Mr. Nutt gives an account is a poem of 60,000 verses, I shall not
be expected to attempt any summary of his book. I shall content myself
with the more popular account of the Sangreal, in its immediate
relation to Malory's Morte Darthur. According to the romances of Le S.
Graal, Lancelot du Lac, Perceforest, and Morte Arthur, the Sangreal, or
Holy Graal, was the dish which held the paschal lamb of the Last
Supper. Joseph of Arimathea having gone into the house where the Supper
had been eaten, took away the dish, and in it received the blood from
the wounds of Jesus; and this dish, 'with part of the blood of our
Lord,' he brought with him into England, and with it converted many
heathens; and it was kept in a tower expressly built for it at
Corbenicy. The romance of Merlin says that 'this vessel was brought to
this said knight [Joseph of Arimathea] by our Lord Jesu Christ while he
was in prison xl. winter, him to comfort,' but does not mention its
earlier history.

When Caxton replied to the 'noble and divers gentlemen of this realm of
England' who urged him to print the history of Arthur, that many
persons held the opinion that there was no such Arthur, 'one in
special' insisted that this was mere blindness, since Arthur's
sepulchre was to be seen at Glastonbury, Gawaine's skull at Dover, the
Round Table at Winchester, as well as many other relics. And if this
noble gentleman had only known it, he might have added that the Holy
Grail itself was to be seen in the Cathedral Church of Genoa. There it
is still shewn. It is an hexagonal dish, about seventeen inches across,
and was long supposed to be a single emerald, which stone it resembles
in colour and brilliancy. It is called 'Sagro Catino,' with a tradition
which makes it to be the Holy Grail we have just described, and with
the addition that it was brought to Solomon by the Queen of Sheba. It
was taken, on the capture of Caesarea, by the Genoese under Guglielmo
Embriaco in 1101 A. D. Like the other plunder of Italian cities it was
taken to Paris by Napoleon I, and restored after the peace of 1815, but
was broken in pieces on the road from careless packing. It is now kept
together by a wire frame: and when I saw it in the Cathedral treasury a
few years since I was gravely told that it was broken in its return
from the Paris 'Exposition' of Napoleon III[13].


INFLUENCE OF THE BOOK ON ENGLISH LETTERS AND LIFE.
--------------------------------------------------

The influence of Sir Thomas Malory's book upon English literature, and
so upon English life, upon our thoughts, morals, and manners, has been
great and important. I have spoken of its claims to be considered an
Epic poem; but it is not the less true, that it is our first great work
of English prose, the first in which the writing of prose was shown to
be one of the fine arts for England. Malory's style is often
inartificial: he is not always able to master the huge masses of his
materials, and fails to fuse and mould them into a perfect whole. But
we must confess the like of Milton, whose grand periods of magnificent
English are often followed by others which are confused and cumbrous in
form, if not in thought. It has taken many workmen, through many
generations, to make our prose writing what it is: but there is an
infant beauty in Malory's style which is full of promise of the perfect
manly form that is to be. The passages which I have already quoted are
instances of this inartificial beauty of style. The thoughts and images
spontaneously utter themselves in words without any attempt at
rhetorical balance and arrangement. Thus in the lament of Sir Ector
over Sir Launcelot, Malory does not ask himself whether there is a
logical connection between courtesy and bearing a shield, or between
true friendship and bestriding a horse, as a modern writer would have
done, and so brought those sentences into a more finished though more
monotonous correspondence with the rest. The flow of feeling is true,
direct, and simple, and that is enough. Dr. Sommer, in his notes on the
language of 'Le Morte Darthur,' points to the indications, in grammar,
spelling, and other usages of words, of its transitional place between
the language of Chaucer and that of Shakespeare; while Southey says
that it was composed in the best possible time for making it what it
is: and Mr. J. A. Symonds (whom I am permitted to name) says:--'The
Morte Darthur was written at a lucky moment in our literary history,
when the old Saxon fountain of speech was yet undefiled, and when
printing had not introduced stereotyped forms or enforced the laws of a
too scrupulous grammar; at the same time the language is truly
English--rich in French and Latin words, as well as Saxon, and not so
archaic as to be grotesque or repulsive[14].

And if in these things Malory was happy in the opportuneness of the
times in which he wrote, not less was he so in that he lived in a day
in which (as we see from Caxton's Preface) men could still believe in
the marvellous adventures of knight-errantry. A hundred years later,
the spirit of chivalry had so departed from the old forms that Spenser
could only use them as materials for allegory, while Cervantes, himself
full of the old spirit, could only treat the belief in knight-errantry
as the fantasy of a crazed though generous mind. But Malory was still
able to embody the ideals of chivalry in actual and serious personages,
and so to influence the national character and manners of his
countrymen in the best way. His book is a possession for all times. The
old stock is still putting out new leaves and fruits for ourselves.


THE MORALITY OF THE BOOK.
-------------------------

In morals as well as in language (though more obscurely, since the
subject of morals is so much more complicated than that of philology),
we may find signs of a transition from the times of Chaucer to those of
Shakespeare, and of progress no less than transition. The suppression
of the Lollards--hated alike by the Church and the feudal lords, the
War of the Roses, and the licentiousness of the court and courtiers,
must, in the days of Edward IV, in which Malory wrote, have cut the
moral and social life of the country down to its roots. Yet even in
Malory's book there are signs of the new moral life which was coming,
and which in the days of the Reformation reached a power and expansion
never before known. It would be absurd to pretend that Malory had
greatly advanced in morality from the position of Chaucer and his age
towards that of the Elizabethan period. Roger Ascham, indeed, while
admitting that 'ten Morte Arthurs do not the tenth part so much harm as
one of these books made in Italy and translated in England,' protests
against the demoralising effect of the literature of which he takes
this book as the example, 'the whole pleasure of which,' he says,
'standeth in two special points--in open manslaughter and bold bawdray.
In which book those be counted the noblest knights that do kill most
men without any quarrel, and commit foulest adulteries by subtlest
shifts[15].' I remember Dante's story of the sin and doom of Paolo and
Francesca--

> 'Galeotto fu il libro, e chi lo scrisse'--

and recognise a real though only half truth in Ascham's strictures. But
he greatly over-states the evil, while he altogether omits to recognise
the good in the book. Caxton's estimate of the moral purport of the
whole book, gives not merely the other side, but both sides of the
case. Much more than half the 'open manslaughter' is done in putting
down cruel oppressors and bringing back kingdoms from anarchy to law
and good government; and the occasions call forth all the knightly
virtues of gentleness, forbearance, and self-sacrifice, as well as
those of courage and hardihood. And though it is far from possible to
deny the weight of Ascham's other charge, yet we must not, in forming
our estimate of the book, forget the silent yet implied judgment which
is passed upon lawless love by its tragic end, nor the ideal presented
in the lives of the maiden knights, Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale. For
the purpose of a due estimate of Malory's 'Morte Darthur,' we may
fairly take Caxton's Preface as an integral part of the book. The
Preface gives the tone, the motive, to the whole book. The morality of
'Morte Darthur' is low in one essential thing, and this alike in what
it says and in what it omits: and Lord Tennyson shows us how it should
be raised. The ideal of marriage, in its relation and its contrast with
all other forms of love and chastity, is brought out in every form,
rising at last to tragic grandeur, in the _Idylls of the King_. It is
not in celibacy, though spiritual and holy as that of Galahad or
Percivale, but in marriage, as the highest and purest realisation of
the ideal of human conditions and relations, that we are to rise above
the temptations of a love like that of Launcelot or even of Elaine; and
Malory's book does not set this ideal of life before us with any power
or clearness. In no age or country has the excellence of marriage, as
the highest condition of man's life, been wholly unknown: but Luther
and the Reformation brought it first into the full light of day, when
he, a monk, married a nun, and thus in the name of God, declared that
the vows of marriage were more sacred and more binding than those of
the convent, and that the one might be lawfully set aside by the other.
And we know how this ideal of love in marriage is worked out by
Shakespeare. With Shakespeare it is marriage which explains, justifies,
forgives, glorifies, and blesses every prosperous and happy condition
of life, and gives an abiding peace as well as dignity to the closing
scenes of his deepest tragedies. Marriage not only sheds its radiance
upon the loves of Ferdinand and Miranda, and of Rosalind and Orlando,
but on all around them: marriage justifies the boldness of Helena as
the love of Elaine, touching as its self-surrender is, cannot do: it
secures forgiveness to the weak and foolish Leontes, and even to the
worthless Angelo; it is to the husband of Desdemona that we find
ourselves constrained to accord the pardon and the sympathy which she
herself had given him. And no one will know Hamlet as he is, nor fully
understand his tragic destiny, unless he sees what it might have been,
as his mother saw it, when she exclaims:--

> 'Sweets to the sweet, farewell!
> I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
> I thought thy bridal bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
> And not have strew'd thy grave.'

But this is Shakespeare's Ophelia, not the preposterous misconception
of Tieck and Goethe, who should have been warned by Polonius not 'to
cast beyond themselves in their opinions.'

If Morte Arthur does not deserve the unqualified denunciation of the
learned Ascham, it cannot be denied that it exhibits a picture of a
society far lower than our own in morals, and depicts it with far less
repugnance to its evil elements, on the part either of the author or
his personages, than any good man would now feel. Still--with the
exception of stories like those of the birth of Arthur and Galahad,
which show not only another state of manners from our own, but also a
really different standard of morals from any which we should now hold
up--the writer does for the most part endeavour, though often in but an
imperfect and confused manner, to distinguish between vice and virtue,
and honestly to reprobate the former; and thus shows that his object is
to recognize and support the nobler elements of the social state in
which he lived, and to carry them towards new triumphs over the evil.
And even where, as in the story of Tristram, there is palliation rather
than reprobation of what Sir Walter Scott justly calls 'the extreme
ingratitude and profligacy of the hero,' still the fact that such
palliation, by representing King Mark as the most worthless of men, was
thought necessary in the later, though not in the earlier, romance on
the same subject, shows an upward progress in morals; while a real
effort to distinguish virtue from vice is to be seen in the story of
Launcelot, with his sincere though weak struggles against temptation,
and his final penitence under the punishment of the woes which his
guilt has brought on all dear to him as well as to himself. Or if we
look at the picture which Chaucer's works give us of the co-existence
in one mind--and that one of the noblest of its age--of the most
virtuous Christian refinement and the most brutish animal coarseness,
and then see how in the pages of Malory, inferior as we must hold him
to be to Chaucer, the brutish vice has dwindled to half its former
size, and is far more clearly seen to be vice, while the virtue, if not
more elevated in itself, is more avowedly triumphant over the evil, we
find the same upward progress. And I cannot doubt that it was helped on
by this book, and that notwithstanding Ascham's condemnation of Morte
Arthur, Caxton was right in believing that he was serving God and his
countrymen by printing it; and that he justly estimated its probable
effect when he says, 'Herein may be seen noble chivalry, courtesy,
humanity, friendliness, hardiness, love, friendship, cowardice, murder,
hate, virtue, sin. Do after the good, and leave the evil, and it shall
bring you to good fame and renommée.... All is written for our
doctrine, and for to beware that we fall not to vice nor sin, but to
exercise and follow virtue, by which we may come and attain to good
fame and renommé in this life, and after this short and transitory life
to come unto everlasting bliss in heaven; the which He grant us that
reigneth in heaven, the blessed Trinity. Amen.'


SPENSER, MILTON, TENNYSON.
--------------------------

It can hardly be doubted that Spenser, while drawing largely from
Geoffrey of Monmouth, was acquainted with Malory's story of Arthur, if
not with the earlier romances also. We might have known this with
certainty, if Spenser had completed his great design which he sketched
in his letter to Sir Walter Raleigh, prefixed to the first three books
of the _Faerie Queene_, and after labouring 'to pourtrait in Arthur
before he was king, the image of a brave knight, perfected in the
twelve Morall Vertues,' he might have been 'perhaps encouraged to frame
the other part of Politick Vertues in his person, after that he came to
be King.' He farther identifies his hero as the son of the Lady
Igraine, and the infant charge of Merlin, and his description of the
Redcross Knight and his claim to the adventure of Una, must forcibly
recall Malory's story of Beaumains and the lady Linet, notwithstanding
the differences between the two. Beyond this, there is the evidence of
general literary probability. Spenser's ideals of knighthood and
knight-errantry are so much in harmony with those of Malory, while they
rise into a far higher moral life, that it does not seem unreasonable
to suppose a relation between the two, and to believe that we owe to
Malory the transmission from the earlier romances of all that was worth
preserving in these to the generation which could give birth to the
_Faerie Queene_.

And while Spenser strove to carry forward the national life of his
countrymen by presenting the noblest ideals of chivalry under the old
forms of romance, Shakespeare was embodying them in the new forms
destined thenceforth to take the place of the old, and showing us in a
Ferdinand, a Prince Henry, or a Hamlet, the ideals of the _Gentleman_,
while the Sydneys and the Raleighs were presenting the counterpart in
actual life. Ben Jonson, too, though he makes fun of 'the whole sum of
Errant Knighthood' in his _Execration upon Vulcan_, elsewhere describes
the old training of pages and squires in chivalry, as 'the noblest way
of breeding up our youth in all the blazon of a gentleman.'

Of Milton's debt to Malory there is no less probability. He no doubt
knew the other legends of Arthur, but Malory's book must surely have
had some part in taking that hold on his imagination, and exercising
that influence in the formation of his character and life, of which he
himself tells us. In his poem addressed to Giovanni Battista Manso,
Marquis of Villa, the friend of Tasso, and of himself when he visited
Naples, he says:--

> 'O mihi si mea sors talem concedat amicum;
> Phoebaeos decorasse viros qui tam bene nôrit,
> Si quando indigenas revocabo in carmina reges,
> Arturumque etiam sub terris bella moventem;
> Aut dicam invictae sociali foedere mensae
> Magnanimos Heroas, et (O modo spiritus adsit)
> Frangam Saxonicas Britonem sub Marte phalanges.'--_Mansus_ 78[16].

The like hope and purpose of writing an Epic poem of British story is
to be found in the _Epitaphium Damonis_. And in his defence of his life
in the 'Apology for Smectymnuus,' he says:--

'Next, (for hear me out now, readers), that I may tell ye whither my
younger feet wandered; I betook me among those lofty fables and
romances, which recount in solemn cantos the deeds of knighthood
founded by our victorious kings, and from thence had in renown over all
christendom. There I read it in the oath of every knight, that he
should defend to the expence of his best blood, or of his life, if it
so befel him, the honour and chastity of virgin or matron; from whence
even then I learned what a noble virtue chastity sure must be, to the
defence of which so many worthies, by such a dear adventure of
themselves, had sworn; and if I found in the story afterward, any of
them, by word or deed breaking that oath, I judged it the same fault of
the poet, as that which is attributed to Homer, to have written
indecent things of the gods; only this my mind gave me, that every free
and gentle spirit, without that oath, ought to be born a knight, nor
needed to expect the gilt spur, or the laying of a sword upon his
shoulder to stir him up both by his counsel and his arms, to secure and
protect the weakness of any attempted chastity. So that even these
books, which to many others have been the fuel of wantonness and loose
living; I cannot think how, unless by divine indulgence, proved to me
so many incitements, as you have heard, to the love and steadfast
observation of virtue.'

In a word, not the fears of Ascham but the hopes of Caxton were now
fulfilled in Milton's study of the old romances.

And though it were idle and mistaken to wish that the poet had finally
chosen the Death of Arthur rather than Paradise Lost, the lovers of the
story of the Round Table may be forgiven if they wish it were possible
to call up him who left untold that story as it would have been seen in
the light of his genius.

Such a transformation has, indeed, been effected for us by Lord
Tennyson in his _Idylls of the King_. He who has been familiar with the
old Morte Arthur from his boyhood, must consent to let the poet
transport him into a quite new region of the imagination, and must in a
manner and for the time forget the old before he can read the _Idylls
of the King_ without a somewhat sad feeling that these are not the old
knights whom he has always known. I have already likened Malory's work
to a mediæval castle, and, if I may be allowed to vary my parable a
little, I would say this: There are some of us who in their childhood
lived in, or can at least remember, some old house, with its tower and
turret stairs, its hall with the screen, and the minstrel's gallery,
and the armour where it was hung up by him who last wore it: the
panelled chambers, the lady's bower, and the chapel, and all the quaint
rambling passages and steps which lead from one to another of these.
And when in after years he comes to this same house, and finds that it
has all been remodelled, enlarged, furnished and beautified to meet the
needs and the tastes of modern life, he feels that this is not the very
home of his childhood, and that a glory has departed from the scenes he
once knew: and yet, if the changes have been made with true judgment,
and only with a rightful recognition of the claim that the modern life
should have full scope for itself while preserving all that was
possible of the old, though not letting itself be sacrificed or even
cramped and limited, for its sake: if he is thus reasonable, he will
acknowledge that it was well that the old order should yield place to
the new, or at least make room for it at its side. And such are the
thoughts and sentiments with which the lover of the old Morte Arthur
will, if he be also a student of the growth of our national character
and life, read the new _Idylls of the King_.


SIR THOMAS MALORY.
------------------

Of Sir Thomas Malory himself we know nothing more than can be inferred
by probable conjecture from his book. His name occurs in it three
times, and with the three variations of Malorye, Malory, and Maleore.
These variations are not singular, for the spelling of proper as well
as of common names was very much at the fancy of the writer; and we
know that Shakespeare, Marvell, and Pym, wrote their own names in
various forms. Sir Thomas Malory tells us that his book was ended in
the ninth year of the reign of Edward IV, or 1470 A.D.; and at that
time there was an old and important Yorkshire family of the name at
Hutton Coniers and High Studley, near Ripon; for Leland, early in the
next century, speaks of the ancestors of Malory[17], and in 1427 and
1472 the death or burial of two persons of the same name is recorded at
Ripon[18]. Andrew Mallorie of Middlesex _armiger_ is among the
contributors to the funds for defence against the Spanish Armada
(1588)[19]. At the beginning of the seventeenth century we find Sir
John Mallory of Studley, and son of Sir William Mallory, M.P. for
Thirsk and Ripon, and a subscriber to the second Virginia Charter[20]:
in 1622 Burton speaks of the pedigree, arms, and lands of Sir Thomas
Malory in Kirby-Malory, Winwick, Newbould, and Swinford in
Leicestershire[21]; and about the same time two scholars of the name
were elected to Winchester College[22]; and reasonable conjecture may
connect our author with these Malorys, although no links of actual
pedigree have been found.

The _Biographia Britannica_ (article 'Caxton') says:--

'If this Sir Thomas Malory was a Welshman, as Leland and others after
him assert, he was probably a Welsh Priest; as appears not only by the
legendary vein which runs through all the stories he has thus extracted
and wove together, but by his conclusion of the work itself, in these
words: “Pray for me, whyle I am on lyve, that God sende me good
delyveraunce; and when I am deed, I praye you all, praye for my soule;
for this booke was ended the 9th yeer of the reygne of Kyng Edward the
Fourth, by Syr Thomas Maleore, Knyght, as Jesu helpe him for his grete
myght, as he is the _servaunte_ of Jesu, bothe day and nyght.”'

But no references are given as to where this supposed assertion by
'Leland and others' is to be found; in fact, it is not to be found in
any of Leland's writings. And the origin of the statement remained an
unexplained puzzle, until Dr. Sommer has now apparently discovered the
key to it in a passage which he quotes from Bale's _Illustrium Maioris
Britanniæ Scriptorum_, &c., first edition, folio 208. In this passage,
Bale, after praising Thomas Mailorius and his history of King Arthur,
goes on to say, '_Est Mailoria in finibus Cambriæ regio_,' on the
authority of Leland[23]. I have not myself verified these references,
but I infer from what Dr. Sommer tells us, that Bale, perhaps writing
from an imperfect recollection, supposed that he had the authority of
Leland for a connection between Mailorius, and the Welsh place of the
like name: and then the writer of the _Biographia Britannica_, still
more inaccurately, converted the possible suggestion of Bale into the
direct statement that Leland had asserted Malory to be a Welshman,
while Bale himself is referred to as 'the others.' Nor is there any
reason to suppose from Malory's own book that he was a Welshman. Though
Caxton tells us that there were books in Welsh about Arthur and his
Knights, Malory never quotes any but the French and English books. He
shows no acquaintance with Welsh legends or traditions, unless it be
with those in Geoffrey of Monmouth, who wrote in Latin, nor of any
local knowledge of Welsh places. Then as to the fanciful and
inconsequent conjecture that he was a priest, he himself tells us that
he was a knight, and thus implies that he was not a priest, while the
words that 'he is the servant of Jesu by day and by night,' which
suggested the notion that he was a priest, are evidently put into that
form in order to give a rhythmical ending to the book. Nor did the
priest's usual title of 'Sir' make him a knight. What we may say of Sir
Thomas Malory is that he was probably of an old English family: that he
was a knight both in rank and in temper and spirit, and a lover alike
of the gentle and the soldierly virtues of knighthood. He was a man of
genius, and a devout Christian: he wrote for gentlewomen as well as
gentlemen, believing that they would read his book 'from the beginning
to the ending,' and that it would call forth in them a sympathy which
would properly express itself in prayers for the pious writer.


WILLIAM CAXTON.
---------------

Of William Caxton we know more. A native of Kent, he became an
apprentice, freeman, and livery man of the London Guild of Mercers, and
was for many years resident in the English factory at Bruges, which was
under their chief authority, though it represented and controlled all
English trading interests in the Low Countries. Such factories were the
usual, and indeed essential means of carrying on trade with foreign
nations in the Middle Ages. Thus charters were granted by Henry IV and
his successors to 'Merchant Adventurers' trading in Flanders, which, in
giving them a corporate character, enabled them to treat with the
authorities of the country more effectually than would have been
possible to private individuals, and also to exercise needful control
over, and give protection to, their own countrymen in the place. Though
these Merchant Adventurers included many of the City Guilds, the
majority were Mercers, and the factory at Bruges, while called 'the
English Nation,' and its house 'the English House,' was practically
under the management of the London Mercers' Guild. Mr. Blades has given
an engraving from _Flandria Illustrata_ of the 'Domus Anglorum' at
Bruges as it was in Caxton's time; and he thus describes the mode of
life of its inhabitants:--

> 'A great similarity prevailed in the internal management of all
> foreign guilds, arising from the fact that foreigners were regarded
> by the natives with jealousy and suspicion. The laws which governed
> the Esterlings in London, who lived in a strongly-built enclosure,
> called the Steel Yard, the site of which is now occupied by the
> City station of the South Eastern Railway Company, were much the
> same as those under which the English Nation lived in Bruges and
> other cities. The foreign merchant had, in Caxton's time, to brave
> a large amount of popular dislike, and to put up with great
> restraints on his liberty. Not only did he trade under harassing
> restrictions, but he resigned all hopes of domestic ties and family
> life. As in a monastery, each member had his own dormitory, whilst
> at meal-times there was a common table. Marriage was out of the
> question, and concubinage was followed by expulsion. Every member
> was bound to sleep in the house, and to be in-doors by a fixed time
> in the evening, and for the sake of good order no woman of any
> description was allowed within the walls[24].'

To this house of the English in Bruges Caxton went to live in the year
1441, being then probably about twenty years of age. In 1462 he was
acting as 'Governor of the English Nation in the Low Countries,' and
certainly in full possession of that office and title two or three
years later. And in 1465 he was appointed by Edward IV one of two
envoys with the title of Ambassadors, to negociate a renewal of the
existing treaty of trade with the Duke of Burgundy. We do not know at
what time he began to combine his literary studies or his acquaintance
with the new art of printing with the prosecution of his official
duties: but he tells us that in 1471, at the request of Margaret,
sister of Edward IV and wife of the Duke of Burgundy, he completed his
translation of the _Recuyell of the Histories of Troye_ which he had
begun, but laid aside unfinished some time before. And then, in order
to meet the desire of many friends to have copies of this translation,
he printed such copies for their use.

He was now in the service of Margaret, and married; and about the year
1476, after thirty-five years' residence abroad, he returned to
England, there to introduce the Printing Press, and to make himself
famous to all ages by so doing. Caxton was not only a printer, but a
translator, an editor, and the publisher of the books which he printed
in unfailing succession, during the remaining fifteen years of his
life. He was the first of that honourable order of publishers who from
his day to our own still share with authors the gratitude of men for
that inestimable boon, the Printed Book. There are still publishers
among us who, like Caxton, are themselves authors and editors of no
unimportant ability: and not only to them, but also to those who aspire
only to be the publishers of other men's books, do we owe--what even
the art of printing could have done little towards giving us--that
broad spreading[25] of knowledge which has become to us like the common
light of day in which we live and move, only half conscious of its
blessings. Mr. Blades justly defends Caxton against Gibbon's censure of
him because he did not print the ancient classics. He did far better.
He printed and published translations from those classics for men who
could not read the originals; and it was surely no loss, but the
greatest gain, to Englishmen that he enabled them to read Chaucer's
_Canterbury Tales_ and the _Polychronicon of English History_ (which
latter he carried down to his own time) rather than if he had printed
Virgil and Livy in the original Latin. He laid the foundations of
popular English literature in the best possible way. He taught his
countrymen to read, by giving them a large and judiciously selected
succession, year by year, of books which they could and would read. He
gave them books of piety and devotion, poetry and history, of chivalry
and romance, of morals and manners, including his own translations of
Cicero's _Old Age and Friendship_; of proverbs, fables, and classical
legends; of statutes of the realm; and the _Game of Chess_, an allegory
of civil government. We cannot read down the list of ninety-nine books,
including several second and third editions, which Caxton printed,
without wonder and respect for the genius and the judgment of the man
whose choice of subjects was so wide, so high-minded, moral, religious,
and generous, and at the same time so popular. He was indeed, in all
senses, the first of English publishers. He died in 1491, occupied (as
his chief workman and successor, Wynkyn de Worde, tells us) on the last
day of his life in finishing his translation of the _Lives of the
Fathers_ from the French. Mr. Blades conjectures, with apparent
probability, that his wife was the Mawde Caxton whose burial is
recorded in the parish books of St. Margaret's in 1489, and he adds:--

'If so, it will explain, in a most interesting manner, the reason why
he in that year suspended printing the _Fayts of Arms_ until he had
finished a new undertaking, _The Arte and Crafte to Die Well_.'

The operation of the silent but never-failing laws which govern the
growth and progress of our national life, seems to be sustained and
directed in certain epochs of our history by great men who have yet
themselves been made what they are by those very laws. Among such laws
are the ideals of chivalry in its twofold aspect of self-sacrifice and
of self-assertion. And not least among the men who have given to the
spirit of chivalry its special English forms in which the sense of duty
and zeal in the redress of wrongs are characteristic, stand Sir Thomas
Malory and William Caxton.


2. THE TEXT, AND ITS SEVERAL EDITIONS.
--------------------------------------

The first edition of Le Morte Darthur was printed by Caxton at
Westminster in 1485, as he tells us in the colophon. Two copies only
are known: they are folio, black letter, with wide margin, and among
the finest specimens of Caxton's printing. One belongs to Mrs. Abby E.
Pope, of Brooklyn, United States, by whom it was bought for £1950 at
the sale of the Osterley library in 1885[26]; and the other to Earl
Spencer. The Osterley copy, which is perfect, has the autograph
'Oxford' on the first leaf; it was sold with the Harleian Library to
Osborne the bookseller, and apparently bought of him for £5 5_s._ by
Bryan Fairfax, who sold his library to Mr. Child, maternal ancestor of
the Earl of Jersey[27]. The Althorp copy, which was bought at Mr.
Lloyd's sale in 1816 for £320, had eleven leaves deficient; but these
were supplied by Mr. Whittaker in fac-simile from the Osterley copy
with remarkable skill[28], though on collation with the original I have
found many mistakes. This edition, like all Caxton's books but one, has
no title-page; the Prohem or Preface begins at the top of the first
page[29].

The two next editions of Morte Arthur were printed by Wynkyn de Worde,
the chief workman and successor of Caxton, in 1498 and 1529. Only one
copy of each is known. That of 1498 is in the Althorp Library: it wants
some pages, but contains the Preface, which is a reprint of that of
Caxton, though it here follows instead of preceding the Table of
Contents. This edition, which has numerous woodcuts, is not an exact
reprint of Caxton's; there are differences of spelling and occasionally
of a word; and the passage in the last chapter but one, beginning 'Oh
ye mighty and pompous lords,' and ending with 'turn again to my
matter,' which is not in Caxton's edition, appears here, as in all
later editions[30]. The edition of 1529 is in the British Museum, and
wants the Title, Preface, and part of the Table of Contents.

In 1557 the book was reprinted by William Copland, with the title of
'The story of the most noble and worthy kynge Arthur, the whiche was
one of the worthyes chrysten, and also of his noble and valiaūte
knyghtes of the rounde Table. Newly imprynted and corrected mccccclvij.
Imprynted at London by Wyllyam Copland.' And on the title-page, above
the last line, is a woodcut of St. George and the Dragon, of which that
on the title-page of Southey's edition is a bad copy. A copy of this
edition is in the British Museum, with a note that this is the only one
with a title which the annotator has seen.

A folio and a quarto edition were published by Thomas East, without
date, but probably about 1585, the former of which is in the British
Museum.

The next, and last black-letter, edition is that of William Stansby, in
1634, which has been reprinted by Mr. Wright, and which contains the
woodcut of the Round Table with Arthur in the middle and his knights
around, a copy of which is familiar to many of us in one of the small
editions of 1816. From the fact of an omission in this edition which
exactly corresponds with a complete leaf in East's folio, Mr. Wright
concludes that the one was printed from the other. Each succeeding
edition departs more than the previous one from the original of Caxton;
but if we compare this of 1634 with Caxton's, we find the variations
almost infinite. Besides remodelling the preface, dividing the book
into three parts, and modernising the spelling and many of the words,
there are a number of more or less considerable variations and
additions, of which Mr. Wright has given some of the more important in
his notes, but which I estimate at above twenty thousand in the whole;
and which have probably arisen in the minor instances from the printer
reading a sentence and then printing it from recollection, without
farther reference to his 'copy,' but in the others from a desire to
improve the original simplicity by what the editor calls 'a more
eloquent and ornated style and phrase.'

No new edition seems to have been published till 1816, when two
independent editions appeared, one in two, and the other in three 24mo
volumes. Both are modernised for popular use, and are probably the
volumes through which most of my own generation made their first
acquaintance with King Arthur and his knights; but neither has any
merit as to its editing.

In 1817 Messrs. Longmans and Co. published an edition in two volumes
quarto, with an introduction and notes by Southey, who says,'The
present edition is a reprint with scrupulous exactness from the first
edition by Caxton, in Earl Spencer's library[31].' As it appears from a
note[32] that he had nothing to do with the superintendence of the
press, which was undertaken by Mr. Upcott, he was probably unaware that
eleven leaves were, as I have mentioned above, then wanting in the copy
from which this reprint was made. These had not then been restored in
fac-simile; for Earl Spencer's copy contains a note, signed by Messrs.
Longmans and dated 1816, which gives a list of the pages then wanting;
and, in fact, the substitutes for them which actually appear in
Southey's edition differ widely from the restored, or the original,
text. Thus in chapter xii. of the last book, besides the interpolation
of the long passage 'O ye myghty and pompous lordes,' &c., which is not
in Caxton, there are in the first eleven lines thirty-five variations
of spelling and punctuation, besides the introduction of the words 'but
continually mourned un--' and 'needfully as nature required,' which are
not in Caxton, and the change of Caxton's 'on the tombe of kyng Arthur
& quene Guenever' into 'on kynge Arthur's & quene Gwenever's tombe.'
And thus throughout the pages in question--seventeen in number[33]--the
spelling constantly, and words and even sentences occasionally, differ
from the real text of Caxton[34].

When at page 113 of volume i. the editor introduces the words 'certayne
cause' to complete the sense, he is careful to call attention, in a
foot-note, to the fact that these words are not in the original, but
taken from the 'second edition,' by which I presume he means that of
1498. But when he subsequently supplies seventeen pages which were also
not in his original, he gives no hint of the fact; and his reticence
was so successful that for fifty years the interpolations passed as
genuine among learned critics, who quoted from them passages wholly
spurious as Caxton's genuine text. It was only in 1867 that, in
collating Earl Spencer's copy with the edition of Southey, I discovered
that these passages--to which my attention was directed by Messrs.
Longman's note above mentioned--did not correspond with Caxton's text,
as represented by Whittaker's restorations: and on afterwards collating
them with the Osterley text itself I found the like result. It remained
to trace them to their real sources. This was not so easy as might be
supposed, for though it was evident that Mr. Upcott must have had
recourse to one or other of the existing editions, the interpolated
passages in fact agree exactly with none of them. But a careful
collation of the last four chapters of the book (which include more
than half the interpolations, and may be taken as a fair specimen of
the whole) with the old texts, leaves no doubt that, with the exception
of the first thirty-six lines of chapter x, they were taken, like the
two words mentioned above, from the first edition of Wynkyn de Worde,
but with the spelling occasionally altered, and here and there a small
word put in, left out, or changed. These alterations throw an ingenious
disguise over the whole; but if we penetrate through this we find that
in these four chapters there are only thirteen words differing from
those in Wynkyn de Worde's first edition, and these unimportant; while
in his second edition, and in those of Copland and East, the variations
from Mr. Upcott's text of the same chapters are respectively
fifty-seven, fifty-six, and fifty in number, and many of them important
in kind: and if we go to the edition of 1634 we find the differences
still greater, except as to those thirty-six lines, which are supplied
from this edition, as they were wanting in the other copy. But the
colophon, or concluding paragraph of the book, Mr. Upcott could not
take from any of the editions which followed that of Caxton; for though
Wynkyn de Worde might, and in fact did, supply at least one or two of
the first words, the latter part of his colophon relates to his own
edition, and departs widely from that of Caxton, while those in the
later editions are still more unlike; and yet Mr. Upcott's colophon is
a tolerable, though not an exact, representation of that of Caxton. But
his other materials can be ascertained beyond a doubt. They are, the
colophon as given by Ames, and repeated by Dibdin in a modernised and
otherwise inexact form[35], and that which first appeared in the
Catalogue of the Harleian Library[36], and was thence copied in the
article on Caxton in the _Biographia Britannica_, and also in Herbert's
Additions to Ames. The colophons of Ames and of the Harleian Catalogue
have important variations from each other and from that of Caxton; and
as Mr. Upcott adopts some portions of each which are not found either
in the other, or in Caxton, we see the manner in which the paragraph in
question was compounded. Each stone of the ingeniously fitted mosaic
may be referred to the place from which it was taken. We cannot indeed
choose positively between Ames and Dibdin, or among the Harleian
Catalogue, the Biographia, and Herbert; but as the two paragraphs which
are required in addition to that of Wynkyn de Worde are both found in
Herbert's Ames, it seems most probable that Mr. Upcott had recourse to
that work, though another combination would have served the purpose
equally well. That the interpolated passages are not taken from the
Osterley Caxton itself, even in the roughest and most careless manner,
is quite evident[37].

In 1858 and 1866 Mr. Wright published successive editions reprinted
from that of 1634. His learned introduction and notes are of
considerable interest; but nothing can justify the reprinting the most
corrupt of all the old editions when the first and best was within
reach, though perhaps at greater cost.

In 1868 was published the first edition of the present volume, with the
purpose of giving the original text in a form available for ordinary
readers, and especially for boys, from whom the chief demand for this
book will always come. It is a reprint of the original Caxton with the
spelling modernised, and those few words which are unintelligibly
obsolete replaced by others which, though not necessarily unknown to
Caxton, are still in use, yet with all old forms retained which do not
interfere with this requirement of being readable. For when, as indeed
is oftenest the case, the context makes even an obsolete phrase
probably, if not precisely, known, I have left it in the text, and
given its meaning in the Glossary, in which I have chiefly followed
Roquefort, Halliwell, and Wright. In the Glossary I have also added a
few geographical notes for those readers who may care for them. And for
the like reason--of making the book readable--such phrases or passages
as are not in accordance with modern manners have been also omitted or
replaced by others which either actually occur or might have occurred
in Caxton's text elsewhere. I say manners, not morals, because I do not
profess to have remedied the moral defects of the book which I have
already spoken of. Lord Tennyson has shown us how we may deal best with
this matter, in so far as Sir Thomas Malory has himself failed to treat
it rightly; and I do not believe that when we have excluded what is
offensive to modern manners there will be found anything practically
injurious to the morals of English boys, for whom I have chiefly
undertaken this work, while there is much of moral worth which I know
not where they can learn so well as from the ideals of magnanimity,
courage, courtesy, reverence for women, gentleness, self-sacrifice,
chastity, and other manly virtues, exhibited in these pages.

The omissions, not many, nor in any sense constituting an abridgment of
the original, were thought desirable to fit the book for popular
reading. And if any one blames the other departures from the exact form
of that original, I would ask him to judge from the specimens of the
old type and spelling which I have given at the end of each book, and
of the volume, whether a literal and verbal reproduction of the whole
would not be simply unreadable except by students of old English[38].
And if some departure from the original was necessary, it was
reasonable to carry it so far as, though no farther than, my purpose
required. And, subject to these conditions, the present volume is in
fact a more accurate reproduction of Caxton's text than any other
except those of Southey and Dr. Sommer. I have, indeed, made use of
Southey's text for this edition, having satisfied myself by occasional
collation with the Althorp and Osterley Caxtons that it is a
sufficiently accurate reprint excepting as to the passages above
mentioned; and these have been taken by me from the original in the way
I have said.

In 1862, 1868, 1871, 1880, abridgments of Malory's book were edited by
J. T. King, E. Conybeare, B. M. Ranking, and S. Lanier, respectively.
And in 1886 Mr. Ernest Rhys edited a reprint of fourteen of the
twenty-one books, from the version of Mr. Wright, with further
modernisations and an introduction.

In 1889, 1890, and 1891, Dr. H. Oskar Sommer edited, and Mr. Nutt
published, in three volumes, what will henceforth be the best, if not
quite the best possible, edition of Caxton's original text, for the
scholar and the student. It would be hard to over-rate the industry,
the learning, and the munificent public spirit of these worthy
representatives of Sir Thomas Malory and William Caxton. The first
volume gives the text of the Althorp copy, page for page, line for
line, word for word, and letter for letter, with no change but that of
Roman for black letter type. It is, indeed, too scrupulously exact, for
it reproduces the mistakes in Whittaker's fac-simile pages which now
form part of the Althorp copy, only correcting these by collations with
the Osterley original, given in the second volume. Whittaker has no
more authority than any other mere copyist; and the direct correction
of his mistakes would have made Dr. Sommer's reprint a perfect
representation of the original while making a reprint of the collations
unnecessary. Besides these collations, and others of the second edition
of Wynkyn de Worde with the text of Caxton, Dr. Sommer's second volume
contains a complete bibliography of the original text and all its after
editions; an Index of names of persons and places; a Glossary, or
indeed dictionary, of words, whether obsolete or still in use; and an
Essay on the language of the book.

In the third volume, after a graceful essay by Mr. Andrew Lang on the
literary merits of Malory, Dr. Sommer gives us a series--an original
and very important series--of 'Studies on the Sources'; and he prints
from MSS. in the British Museum the only two of those 'sources' which
had not been so made accessible already, either by ancient or modern
editors. Into this hitherto chaotic mass of mediæval romances, French
and English, prose or verse, Dr. Sommer has now first brought light and
order. With an almost inconceivable amount of thoughtful and learned
labour, he has collated the various manuscripts with the printed
editions and with Malory's book, in a detail which, great as it is,
represents, as he tells us, a still more minute investigation of which
he only gives the main results. With the exception of the story of
Beaumains, which is an enlarged narration of that of La Cote Male
Taile, and subject to the changes made by Malory's own genius, all the
adventures and incidents of Malory's Morte Darthur are now shown to be
found in one or more of these 'sources,' often translated literally
from French, or transferred word for word from the English, yet still
oftener so compressed and fused into a new shape that the finished work
is but a tenth of the bulk of the original matter. Dr. Sommer arranges
these sources into the four groups of the Merlin, the Lancelot, the
Tristan, and the Prophecies of Merlin, and shows the relations of each
group to the corresponding portions of Malory. He thinks, with M.
Gaston Paris, that Malory had a now lost form of the 'Lancelot,'
comparable to the 'Suite de Merlin' discovered only fifteen years
since; and indeed believes that he has found some pages of this missing
'Lancelot' imbedded in a 'Tristan' MS. in the British Museum. But the
work of this learned critic must be studied in itself, not in a
summary. Of the light which these investigations throw upon the genius
of Malory, and on the character of his art, I have already spoken.

There is no title-page, as I have already mentioned, to the Caxton,
that which is given by several bibliographers being only an extract,
not very critically selected, from Caxton's preface. But it is stated
in Caxton's colophon that the book was 'entytled le morte Darthur,' and
he explains that it was so 'entitled' notwithstanding it treated of
Arthur's birth, life, and acts as well as death, and also of the
adventures of his knights of the Round Table. And the concluding words
of Malory, 'Here is the end of the death of Arthur,' taken with their
context, point to the same title. It was indeed before Malory's time,
and has been ever since, the traditional title of this story. We have
Mort Artus and Morte Arthure in the earlier times; Ascham, in Henry
VIII's reign, calls this book La Morte d'Arthure; Tyrwhitt, Mort
d'Arthur; and Walter Scott and Southey, Morte Arthur, which last
probably many of us are familiar with as the old name which we heard
from our own fathers.


3. AN ESSAY ON CHIVALRY.

St. Augustine replied to the enquiry, What is time? by saying, 'I know
when you do not ask me:' and a like answer suggests itself to us if we
try to find an adequate reply to the question, What is Chivalry? For
chivalry is one of those words, like love, duty, patriotism, loyalty,
which make us feel their meaning, and the reality of what they mean,
though their ideal and comprehensive character hinders us from readily
putting it into the forms of a definition. When the alchemist in the
Eastern tale compounds, with all the resources of his art, the
universal solvent before the expectant eyes of his pupil, the pupil,
seeing the mysterious fluid lie quietly in the crucible, exclaims, with
not unreasonable doubt, 'O Sage, be not deceived: how can that which
dissolves all things be itself contained in a ladle?' And how shall
chivalry, sparkling and flashing everywhere as it runs through that
great complicated tissue of human life which we call modern
civilisation,--how shall chivalry, the humaniser of society, be brought
within the limits of a definition?

Chivalry, indeed, exists for us in spirit rather than in outward and
visible form. It no longer comes to us with the outward symbols of
war-horse, and armour, and noble birth, and strength of arm, and
high-flown protestations of love and gallantry; yet we never fail to
know and feel its presence, silent and unobtrusive as it now is: we
recognise the lady and the gentleman not less surely now than they did
in old times; and we acknowledge their rights and their power over us
now no less than then. And if the spirit of chivalry does live among us
still, we may read its past history by its present light, and say in
Spenser's words,--

> 'By infusion sweete
> Of thine own spirit which doth in me survive,
> I follow still the footing of thy feete,
> That with thy meaning so I may the rather meete.'

Let us then look back to those times when chivalry had an outward,
visible form, and was embodied in its own proper institutions, with
orders, and statutes, and courts of its own jurisdiction, and rituals,
and customs, like those of other great social institutions and members
of the body politic.

The deluge of the Teutonic nations which broke up the old Roman
civilisation threatened for some centuries to overwhelm Europe with
mere barbarism. We know now that the germs of a far higher and better
civilisation were everywhere ready to burst into life as soon as the
fury of that deluge had spent itself; but for a long period the evil
seemed mightier than the good. From time to time the clear head, the
noble heart and conscience, and the strong arm of an Alfred, a
Charlemagne, or an Otho, might bring a temporary calm and order into
the storm; but when the personal influences of such great men were
withdrawn, society relapsed again and again into ever new anarchy, and
war--at once the effect and the cause of anarchy--savage, cruel war
became the business of all men throughout Europe. The selfish, the
rapacious, and the unscrupulous fought for power, and plunder, and love
of fighting; and while violence could only be resisted by violence, and
each man had to defend himself, his family, and his possessions as best
he could, with no effectual aid from law and government, there was a
constant tendency to increasing barbarism and brutish, or worse than
brutish, instead of human, existence.

But man differs from the brutes in this, that while he can fall lower
than they, he can also rise higher, and that even the passions and the
impulses which he has in common with them may be subdued, and refined,
and modified, till they become the servants and instruments of his
human life, and the means by which all that is properly spiritual in
his being may be reflected and symbolised upon this earth in outward,
visible form. The nobler races of men--the historical races, as they
have been called--constantly show this aptitude for contending with
these downward tendencies of our nature, and for advancing, through the
conquest of them, to new and higher life.

And so it was in the Middle Ages. The Church was, no doubt, the great
civiliser of the nations: still, whatever aid the State derived from
the Church, it then, no less than now, had a position and processes of
its own, by which it did its own work of civilisation too. And its
first great work for controlling the universal anarchy of which I have
spoken was the extension and firm establishment of that
half-patriarchal, half-military organisation which we call the Feudal
System. Every man who was not rich and powerful enough to be a lord
became--willingly or unwillingly--a vassal; and all men, from the king
downwards, were bound to each other for reciprocal service and
protection--a service and protection partly military, but partly
patriarchal, since they were rendered not by men strangers to each
other except for what Mr. Carlyle calls 'the nexus of cash payment,'
but united by ties of family, and neighbourhood, and clanship, and by
the interests and sympathies that grow out of these. But the protector
of his own vassals easily became the invader of the rights and ravager
of the possessions of his neighbour and his vassals; and so the old
evils of anarchy and violence grew afresh out of the remedy which had
been devised to meet them. The 'monarchies sank into impotence; petty,
lawless tyrants trampled all social order under foot,' says a learned
historian of this period, 'and all attempts after scientific
instruction and artistic pleasures were as effectually crushed by this
state of general insecurity as the external well-being and material
life of the people. This was a dark and stormy period for Europe,
merciless, arbitrary, and violent. It is a sign of the prevailing
feeling of misery and hopelessness that, when the first thousand years
of our æra were drawing to their close, the people in every country in
Europe looked with certainty for the destruction of the world. Some
squandered their wealth in riotous living, others bestowed it for the
good of their souls on churches and convents; weeping multitudes lay
day and night around the altars; some looked forward with dread, but
most with secret hope, towards the burning of the earth and the falling
in of heaven. Their actual condition was so miserable that the idea of
destruction was relief, spite of all its horrors[39].'

The palliatives with which men tried to meet the evils of the times
indicate the greatness of the evils, but also the moral feeling which
was the promise of better things. Such was the so-called 'Peace of the
King,' by which private wars were not to be entered on till forty days
after the committal of the alleged crime which was to be avenged; and
the 'Truce of God,' by which all these acts of private hostility were
suspended from Thursday to Monday in each week. And at the Council of
Cleremont, held by Urban II in November, 1095, a severe censure was
pronounced against the licence of private war; the Truce of God was
confirmed; women and priests were placed under the safeguard of the
Church; and a protection of three years was extended to husbandmen and
merchants, the defenceless victims of military rapine. We are reminded
of the law of Moses, which provided Cities of Refuge for the man who
accidentally and without malice killed his neighbour, but who could not
look for protection from the vengeance of the family of the slain man
except within those special safeguards. In each case there is the same
unreasoning rage of the half-civilised man brought face to face with
the demands of religion and civil law: and each is obliged to yield
something to the other till the better cause has had time to prepare
and strengthen itself for a more complete triumph.

Chivalry, then, was the offspring of the same spirit which dictated the
Peace of the King, the Truce of God, and the decrees of the Council of
Cleremont. Chivalry has another name--Knighthood--and the two are
wanted to express all that we mean by either[40]. The chevalier was the
soldier who rode the war-horse: he whose birth entitled him, and whose
wealth gave him the means, to ride at the head of his vassals and
retainers to the war: all ideas of lordship, and mastery, and outward
dignity and power, are here embodied before us. But this 'chevalier,'
this 'ritter,' or rider of the war-horse, was also to be a 'knecht,' or
servant: 'He that will be chief among you, let him be your servant.'
The knight was to obey, no less than to command; he was to exert his
strength and power, not for selfish ends, but in the service of others;
and especially in the service of the poor, the weak, and the oppressed,
who could not help or defend themselves. It was, indeed, no new
discovery in the world, that such are the duties of him who possesses
power, and above all the power of the sword; and they who have tried to
trace the origin of chivalry to some particular place and time have had
to go to the Germans of Tacitus, to the Crusaders, to the Saracens, to
the Romans, the Greeks, the Trojans, the Hebrews, only to come to the
conclusion that chivalry belongs in its spirit to man as man; though
the form in which that spirit was clothed in Europe in the Middle Ages
has an individuality of which some of the sources may be ascertained,
and though from that time forward its power has been established, and
extended, in a manner, and with a greatness unknown to the ancients.

In those days society was essentially military. In this our own time
the main offices, interests, and occupations of the great body politic
are non-military, and the army is but a small portion of the nation,
specially trained for a minor, though indispensable, function therein.
Peace, for its own sake, and for the sake of the objects which can only
be obtained by the arts and with the opportunities of peace, is the end
and aim of every civilised nation now; and war is only an occasional
means to secure that end. But in the Middle Ages war was, or seemed to
be, the chief end of life to the greater part of every nation, and
especially to all who possessed rank, and wealth, and power, and were
in fact the leaders of the nation. And therefore chivalry, the spirit
which was to humanise those warriors, needed to be warlike too, and
thus to sympathise with those to whom it addressed itself.

Much, too, of its special form it no doubt owed to that wonderful race
of heroes, the Normans. The romantic love of adventure; the religious
and the martial enthusiasm; the desire to revenge injuries, and to win
wealth and power; the delight in arms and horses, in the luxury of
dress, and in the exercises of hunting and hawking; the eloquence and
sagacity in council; the patience with which when need was they could
endure the inclemency of every climate, and the toil and abstinence of
a military life; and the gentleness, the affability and the gallantry,
which were the characteristics of the Norman race; these must have been
more or less impressed on men's minds wherever the Norman sway or
influence extended, from England to Sicily, and must have reproduced
something of themselves in the social habits and manners of the times.
When we read the description of William of the Iron Arm, the first
Norman count of Apulia, so strong, so brave, so affable, so generous,
and so sage above other men--a lion in battle, a lamb in society, and
an angel in council--we are reminded of the heroes of chivalry in the
days of its greatest refinement, the Black Prince, Sir John Chandos,
and Sir Walter of Manny, as they still live in the pages of Froissart;
or their counterparts in romance, King Arthur, Sir Launcelot, Amadis of
Gaul, or Palmerin of England.

The Normans, the latest of the Northern races who descended, full of
wild life, from their mountains and forests, upon the comparatively
civilised plains of Europe, may have brought a newer and fresher
feeling for those old manners and customs which Tacitus describes as
characterising the Germans of his time, and which are with so much
probability connected with the chivalry of the Middle Ages. In ancient
Germany, and in Scandinavia, it was the custom for each youth, when he
was of an age to bear arms, to be presented with a sword, a shield, and
a lance, by his father, or some near relation, in an assembly of the
chiefs of the nation; and from that time he became a member of the
commonwealth, and ranked as a citizen. He then entered the train of
some chief, of whom he and his brother youths became the followers and
companions, forming one brotherhood, though not without ranks and
degrees, while a generous spirit of equality ran through all.

In ancient Germany, too, women were held in a peculiar reverence,
beyond what was known in the other--and otherwise more
civilized--nations of antiquity; and the presence of women in the hour
of battle with their husbands, brothers, and fathers, was regarded by
those warriors as an incentive to courage, and a pledge of victory,
which (as they boasted) their Roman foes were unable to appeal to for
themselves. And this old Teutonic reverence for women conspired with
the new Christian reverence for the Virgin Mary as the type and
representative at once of her sex and of the Church, to supply the
purer and nobler elements of the gallantry which forms so large a part,
not only of the romance, but of the actual history, of chivalry.

But Christianity exercised not only an indirect, but also a direct and
avowed action upon the forms of chivalry, as they attained to their
full proportions. Knighthood was certainly a feature and distinction of
society before the days of Charlemagne, who in permitting the governor
of Friesland to make knights by girding them with a sword, and giving
them a blow, adds 'as is the custom.' But no ritual of the Church as
yet consecrated that custom. Charlemagne girt the sword on his son
Louis the Good without religious ceremonies; and a century later the
Saxon king of England, Edward the Elder, clothed Athelstan in a
soldier's dress of scarlet, and girded him with a girdle ornamented
with precious stones and a sword with sheath of gold, but without
religious rites. But in the next century, in the reign of Edward the
Confessor, we read that Hereward, a noble Anglo-Saxon youth, was
knighted by the Abbot of Peterborough, with confession, absolution, and
prayer that he might be a true knight. And this the historian describes
as the custom of the English, as indeed it was, or soon became, that of
all Europe; the Normans resisting the innovation longest, but at last
adopting it with their wonted ardour. The candidate for knighthood
confessed his sins on the eve of his consecration (for such it now
was), and passed the night in prayer and fasting in the church: the
godfathers, the bath, the white garment, and the tonsure (sometimes
limited indeed to a single lock) were the symbols of the new and holy
state of life to which he was now called: next morning he heard mass,
offered his sword on the altar, where it was blessed by the priest; and
he was created a knight--either by the priest of highest rank present,
or by some knight, who, in virtue of his knighthood, was qualified to
confer the sacred office he had himself received--in the name of God,
of St. George, and of Saint Michael the Archangel. He swore, and
received the holy communion in confirmation of his oath, to fulfil the
duties of his profession; to speak the truth; to maintain the right; to
protect women, the poor, and the distressed; to practise courtesy; to
pursue the infidels; to despise the allurements of ease and safety, and
to maintain his honour in every perilous adventure. And the Council of
Cleremont, of which I have already spoken--as if in order to give the
sanction of the Church in a still more formal and comprehensive manner
to the whole system of chivalry--decreed that every person of noble
birth, on attaining the age of twelve years, should take a solemn oath
before the bishop of his diocese to defend to the uttermost the
oppressed, the widow, and the orphans; that women of noble birth, both
married and single, should enjoy his especial care; and that nothing
should be wanting in him to render travelling safe, and to destroy
tyranny.

Thus, as has been justly observed, all the humanities of chivalry were
sanctioned by legal and ecclesiastical power: it was intended that they
should be spread over the whole face of Christendom, in order to check
the barbarism and ferocity of the times. While the form of chivalry was
martial, its objects became to a great extent religious and social:
from a mere military array chivalry obtained the name of the Order, the
Holy Order, and a character of seriousness and solemnity was given to
it; and it was accounted an honourable office above all offices,
orders, and acts of the world, except the order of priesthood.

The education for knighthood usually began at a still earlier age than
that mentioned in the Canons of Cleremont. The castles of the princes
and nobles were the schools of those days, at least for the youth of
their own class. Every feudal lord had his court, to which he drew the
sons and daughters of the poorer gentry of his domains; and if he were
a knight distinguished for his merits, his castle was also frequented
by the children of men of equal rank and reputation with himself: for
the prudent and careful father would often have some brother in arms
whom he thought better fitted than himself to educate his children in
the accomplishments and duties of his station. So, long after, Ben
Jonson, looking back on those old times, and picturing them in their
ideal aspect, says, that then

> 'Goodness gave the greatness,
> And greatness worship: every house became
> An academy of honour.'

And that this method of education

> 'By a line
> Of institution from our ancestors,
> Hath been deriv'd down to us, and receiv'd
> In a succession, for the noblest way
> Of breeding up our youth in letters, arms,
> Fair mien, discourses, civil exercises,
> And all the blazon of a gentleman.
> Where can he learn to vault, to ride, to fence,
> To move his body gracefuller, to speak
> His language purer, or to tune his mind
> Or manners more to the harmony of nature,
> Than in these nurseries of nobility?'

The boy of gentle birth, when he thus began his education, was called
by the names of Childe, or Damoiseau, or Valet, said to be a
contraction of Vassalet or little Vassal, and also Page, though this
last name was originally appropriated to the youths of inferior rank.
He usually entered the castle which was to be his school about the age
of seven or eight. He was to learn modesty, obedience, and address in
arms and horsemanship, and was duly exercised in the use of his
weapons, beginning with such as were suited to his strength. He was
instructed how to guide a horse with grace and dexterity, how to use
the bow and the sword, and how to manage the lance,--an art which was
taught him by making him ride against a wooden figure, which, if not
struck in true knightly fashion, was so contrived as to turn round and
give the awkward cavalier a blow with its wooden sword. He attended his
lord in the chase, and learnt all its arts; he attended him also in
many offices which we should now call menial, but which were then held
to be the proper symbols of modesty and obedience for the youth of
highest birth and rank. Thus the Black Prince was held to show the
highest respect to the French king, his prisoner, by personal
attendance on him. In the words of Froissart: 'The same day of the
battle, at night, the prince made a supper in his lodging to the French
king, and to the most part of the great lords that were prisoners ...
and always the prince served before the king as humbly as he could, and
would not sit at the king's board for any desire that the king could
make; but he said he was not sufficient to sit at the table with so
great a prince as the king was.'

And not the least important of the youth's duties were those towards
the ladies of the house in which he lived. He was to wait on them
rather as attending a sort of superior beings to whom adoration and
obsequious service were due, than as ministering to the convenience of
human creatures like himself. The most modest demeanour, the most
profound respect, were to be observed in the presence of these fair
idols. And as not only the youths, but the maidens--the damoiselles no
less than the damoiseaux--were sent to the courts of the barons and
their ladies for education, it would often happen that this veneration
in which the boy was so early trained towards the ladies of maturer
years, would find an object in some young maiden whose more suitable
age might lead him, as he grew up, from mere boyish regard to that
passionate and abiding devotion which was the duty of every true knight
to his lady, and by the strength of which he held that all his power
for good was to be maintained. Here is a description of the beginning
of the loves of Amadis and Oriana, which is as charming as it is
simple; and which, though we find it in the pages of a romance, we
cannot doubt is a picture of actual life and manners. 'Oriana,' says
the old book, 'was about ten years old, the fairest creature that ever
was seen; wherefore she was called the one “without a peer”.... The
child of the sea (that is, Amadis) was now twelve years old, but in
stature and size he seemed fifteen, and he served the queen; but, now
that Oriana was there, the queen gave her the child of the sea, that he
should serve her, and Oriana said that “it pleased her;” and that word
which she said, the child kept in his heart, so that he never lost it
from his memory, and in all his life he was never weary of serving her,
and his heart was surrendered to her; and this love lasted as long as
they lasted, for as well as he loved her did she also love him. But the
child of the sea, who knew nothing of her love, thought himself
presumptuous to have placed his thoughts on her, and dared not speak to
her; and she, who loved him in her heart, was careful not to speak more
with him than with another: but their eyes delighted to reveal to the
heart what was the thing on earth that they loved best. And now the
time came that he thought he could take arms if he were knighted; and
this he greatly desired, thinking that he would do such things that, if
he lived, his mistress should esteem him.'

Such was the beginning of the loves of Amadis and Oriana, so famous in
romance, and so generally held by knights and ladies to be a model for
themselves. Constancy, such as that of Amadis, was a virtue of the true
lover which those times of long inevitable separations and absences
demanded in forms hardly known in our days; and in proportion was it
insisted upon, and held in honour. So Spenser says:

> 'Young knight whatever, that dost arms profess,
> And through long labours huntest after fame,
> Beware of fraud, beware of fickleness,
> In choice and change of thy dear loved dame;
> Lest thou of her believe too lightly blame,
> And rash misweening do thy heart remove;
> For unto knight there is no greater shame,
> Than lightness and inconstancy in love.'

The peerless Amadis passed with more than ordinary rapidity to the rank
of knighthood. The youth more usually remained an esquire--the next
step to that of page--till he was twenty. He attended the knight to
whose person he was attached, dressed and undressed him, trained his
horses, kept his arms bright and burnished, and did the honours of the
household to the strangers who visited it; so that Spenser takes the
squire as the type of such courtesy. Here is Chaucer's description of
the squire:

> 'With him there was his son, a youngé squire,
> A lover and a lusty bachelor,
> With lockés curl'd as they were laid in press;
> Of twenty years of age he was, I guess.
> Of his statúre he was of even length,
> And wonderly deliver, and great of strength;
> And he had been some time in chevachie (military expeditions),
> In Flanders, in Artois, and Picardie,
> And borne him well, as of so little space,
> In hope to standen in his lady's grace.
> Embroider'd was he, as it were a mead
> All full of freshé flowers, white and red;
> Singing he was, or fluting, all the day;
> He was as fresh as is the month of May;
> Short was his gown, with sleevés long and wide:
> Well could he sit on horse, and fairé ride;
> He couldé songés make, and well indite,
> Just, and eke dance, and well pourtray and write:
> So hot he lovéd, that by nightertale
> He slept no more than doth the nightingale.
> Courteous he was; slowly and serviceable;
> And carv'd before his father at the table.'

I have already spoken of the religious rites with which the esquire was
admitted into the order of knighthood, and of the solemn and noble
engagements into which he then entered. He had next to 'win his spurs,'
as it was called; a phrase happily illustrated in the story of Edward
III and the Black Prince, which Froissart thus relates:--

> 'This battle between Broy and Cressy, this Saturday, was right
> cruel and fell, and many a feat of arms done that day came not to
> my knowledge.... In the morning, the day of the battle, certain
> Frenchmen and Almagnes perforce opened the archers of the prince's
> battle (_division_ as we should now say), and came and fought with
> the men of arms, hand to hand. Then the second battle of the
> Englishmen came to succour the prince's battle, the which was time,
> for they had as then much ado. And they with the prince sent a
> messenger to the king, who was on a little windmill hill: then the
> knight said to the king, “Sir, the earl of Warwick, and the earl of
> Oxford, Sir Reynold Cobham, and other, such as lie about the prince
> your son, are fiercely fought withal, and are sore handled,
> wherefore they desire you that you and your battle will come and
> aid them, for if the Frenchmen increase, as they doubt they will,
> your son and they shall have much ado.” Then the king said, “Is my
> son dead, or hurt, or on the earth felled?” “No, sir,” quoth the
> knight, “but he is hardly matched, wherefore he hath need of your
> aid.” “Well,” said the king, “return to him, and to them that sent
> you hither, and say to them, that they send no more to me for any
> adventure that falleth, as long as my son is alive: and also say to
> them, that they suffer him this day to win his spurs; for, if God
> be pleased, I will this day's work be his, and the honour thereof,
> and to them that be about him.” Then the knight returned again to
> them, and showed the king's words, the which greatly encouraged
> them, and repented in that they had sent to the king as they did.'
> Brave knights, to be 'greatly encouraged' by such stern though
> manly words. We are reminded of the not less brave and knightly
> demeanour of Sir Colin Halket and his men at Waterloo, when the
> Duke of Wellington rode up and asked how they were, and the general
> replied that two-thirds of the brigade were down, and the remainder
> so exhausted that the relief of fresh troops, for however short a
> time, was most desirable. But when the duke said that no relief was
> possible, that all depended on _them_, the answer which the officer
> made for himself and his men was, 'Enough, my lord, we stand here
> till the last man falls.'

Thenceforth the knight's career depended, he would not have said on
himself, but on God and his lady: and if we may judge by the ordinary
language of the romances, his lady was often the object of actual
adoration, little differing from that he would have addressed to the
saints in the hour of danger or of triumph. Philosophic divines teach
us that although the worship of the saints may become in practice a
gross and degrading superstition, it has in it an element of true, and
in itself ennobling, faith in ideals of humanity more or less perfectly
revealed in human form: and so while we smile at the fictions of
extravagant fancy in which the mediæval knight was wont to clothe his
love, and his professions of love, for his mistress, we cannot
reasonably doubt that in the main, and for that time of youthful
imaginations rather than of sober reasonings, the knight was right.
When I think of what society was, and what it would still be, without
the humanizing influences of womanhood and ladyhood, and what it is by
means of these, I say that the tree may be judged by its fruits, and
that it is from a right noble stock, rightly and wisely cultivated in
the main, in those old days, that we are still gathering such noble
fruits. Much evil there was along with the good; and, what is worse,
much confusion between good and evil. I need not tell the reader of
chivalry romances, or of Lord Tennyson's reproductions of some of their
incidents in modern form of thought as well as language, how painfully
this confusion defaces many of the fairest characters and most
interesting tales of chivalry, while the historical records of the
times in which those romances were written and read show that the
actual state of morals and manners exhibited the like confusions of
good and evil, in the ideals as well as in the conduct of life. But, as
I have already observed, we see, at least in the romance before us, the
good contending with, and mastering the evil, and this not least in the
end of the story of the guilty loves of Guenever and Launcelot, the
knight whose fame in romance perhaps surpasses that of Amadis, though
even mediæval morality was obliged to censure the constancy of
Launcelot's love, while it might unhesitatingly extol that of Amadis.

Lord Tennyson has, I may assume, made every one familiar with the
retirement of queen Guenever to the nunnery of Almesbury, and with the
death of Arthur; and I venture for the completion of this sketch to
show, though from the present volume, how the old story which the poet
chiefly follows relates the death and draws the character of Launcelot.
Launcelot, when he heard of those events, went to Almesbury, and after
taking leave of the queen, resolved to follow her example; and became a
hermit and penitent, taking up his abode in a forest where was an
hermitage and a chapel that stood between two cliffs; and there he
served God day and night with prayers and fastings. Thus he, and other
knights who followed his example, 'endured great penance six years, and
then Sir Launcelot took the habit of priesthood, and a twelvemonth he
sang mass.' At the end of that time a vision directed him to take the
body of queen Guenever, now dead at Almesbury, and bury her with king
Arthur at Glastonbury. Then the story goes on:--'And when she was put
in the earth Sir Launcelot swooned and lay long still, while the hermit
came out and awaked him, and said, Ye be to blame, for ye displease God
with such manner of sorrow making. Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I trust I
do not displease God, for He knoweth mine intent, for my sorrow was
not, nor is not, for any rejoicing of sin, but my sorrow may never have
end. For when I remember of her beauty, and of her noblesse, that was
both with her king and with her; so when I saw his corpse and her
corpse so lie together, truly mine heart would not serve to sustain my
careful body. Also when I remember me how by my default, and mine
orgule, and my pride, that they were both laid full low, that were
peerless that ever was living of christian people, wit ye well, said
Sir Launcelot, this remembered, of their kindness and mine unkindness,
sank so to my heart, that all my natural strength failed me, so that I
might not sustain myself.' The story goes on to say that there he
wasted away, praying night and day at the tomb of the king and queen.
He died, and was taken to his own castle of Joyous Gard to be buried.
'And right thus as they were at their service there came Sir Ector de
Maris, that had seven year sought all England, Scotland, and Wales,
seeking his brother Sir Launcelot. And when Sir Ector heard such noise
and light in the quire of Joyous Gard he alight, and put his horse from
him, and came into the quire, and there he saw men sing and weep. And
all they knew Sir Ector, but he knew not them. Then went Sir Bors unto
Sir Ector, and told him how there lay his brother Sir Launcelot dead.
And then Sir Ector threw his shield, sword, and helm from him; and when
he beheld Sir Launcelot's visage he fell down in a swoon; and when he
awaked it were hard for any tongue to tell the doleful complaints that
he made for his brother. Ah, Launcelot, he said, thou were head of all
Christian knights! And now, I dare say, said Sir Ector, thou Sir
Launcelot, there thou liest, that thou were never matched of earthly
knight's hands; and thou were the courtiest knight that ever bare
shield; and thou were the truest friend to thy lover that ever bestrode
horse; and thou were the truest lover, of a sinful man, that ever loved
woman; and thou were the kindest man that ever strake with sword; and
thou were the goodliest person ever came among press of knights; and
thou was the meekest man and the gentlest that ever ate in hall among
ladies; and thou were the sternest knight to thy mortal foe that ever
put spear in the rest.'

Let me compare with this Chaucer's description of the knight of his
times:--

> 'A knight there was, and that a worthy[41] man,
> That from the timé that he first began
> To riden out, he loved chivalry,
> Truth and honóur, freedom and courtesy.
> Full worthy was he in his lordés war,
> And thereto had he ridden, no man farre,
> As well in Christendom as in Heatheness,
> And ever honoured for his worthiness.
> At Alisandre he was when it was won:
> Full oftentime he had the board begun
> Aboven allé natións in Prusse[42]:
> In Lethowe had he reyséd[43], and in Russe,
> No Christian man so oft, of his degree:
> In Gernade at the siege eke had he be
> Of Algesir, and ridden in Belmarie:
> At Leyés was he, and at Satalie,
> When they were won; and in the Greaté Sea
> At many a noble army had he be.
> At mortal battles had he been fifteen,
> And foughten for our faith at Tramissene
> In listés thriés, and aye slain his foe.
> This ilké worthy knight had been also
> Sometimé with the lord of Palathie
> Against another heathen in Turkey;
> And evermore he had a sovereign prise[44],
> And though that he was worthy he was wise,
> And of his port as meek as is a maid.
> He never yet no villainy ne said
> In all his life unto no manner wight:
> He was a very perfect gentle knight.'

In an age when all men, not of the clergy, were divided between the two
classes of freemen or gentlemen, and serfs or villains, and the
villains were in habits and in human culture little better than the
domestic animals of which they shared the labours, the knight almost
inevitably belonged to the class of free, or gentle, birth. Still, in
theory always, and to a great extent in practice, it was not his birth,
but his personal merit, which qualified him for knighthood. The
personal merit would oftener exist, and still oftener come to light,
where it had the advantages and aids of education and general social
culture. But if it was recognised in the villain, or man of no rights
of birth, he might be, and often was, knighted, and was thereby
immediately enfranchised, and accounted a gentleman, in law no less
than in name. Thus Froissart tells us of Sir Robert Sale, the governor
of Norwich, that 'he was no gentleman born, but he had the grace to be
reputed sage and valiant in arms, and for his valiantness King Edward
made him knight.' He was governor during the popular insurrection of
which Wat Tyler and Jack Straw were the London leaders; and he was
invited to put himself at the head of one of the risings by men who
urged upon him--'Sir Robert, ye are a knight and a man greatly beloved
in this country, and renowned a valiant man; and though ye be thus, yet
we know you well: ye be no gentleman born, but son to a villain, such
as we be: therefore come you with us, and be our master, and we shall
make you so great a lord that one quarter of England shall be under
your obeisance.' He refused, and they killed him. The same king also
knighted the man-at-arms, son of a tanner, who was afterwards famous as
Sir John Hawkwood. And the courtly as well as knightly Chaucer, who
must more or less have reflected the feeling of the royal and noble
personages among whom he lived, goes farther, and asserts that not only
does virtue make the gentleman, but also baseness of mind the villain
or churl:--

> 'But understand in thine intent,
> That this is not mine intendement,
> To clepen no wight in no age
> Only gentle for his lineage;
> But whoso that is virtuous,
> And in his port nought outrageous,
> Though he be not gentle born,
> Thou may'st well see this in soth,
> That he is gentle because he doth
> As longeth to a gentleman;
> Of them none other deem I can:
> For certainly, withouten drede,
> A churl is deemed by his deed,
> Of high or low, as you may see,
> Or of what kindred that he be.'

Akin to this recognition of gentleness of mind and manners, as that
which made a gentleman, was the sense of brotherhood among knights and
gentlemen, which led them to trust in each other's honour, even when
they were fighting under the banners of hostile kings. The chronicles
are full of the instances of such consideration of the English and
French knights for each other in the wars between the two nations; and
it is not without probability that to these and suchlike manifestations
of the spirit of chivalry have been traced the courtesy and humanity
which characterise modern warfare in a degree unknown to the ancients.

Much indeed of barbarism and cruelty there was in the usages of war in
the best times of chivalry, even of the knights among themselves, and
still more when they came, with passions infuriated by resistance, upon
the people of lower rank than themselves. Edward III of England, and
the knights whom he gathered round him, are held alike by contemporary
historians and romance writers, and by those of modern times, to have
best exhibited the characteristics of chivalry in its day of greatest
refinement as well as splendour; yet no one can read the chronicles of
even the admiring Froissart without seeing how much savage passion and
cruelty was often mingled with their better dispositions: though we do
see also that the cruelty was not because, but in spite of their
chivalry. Froissart laments bitterly the iniquity of the massacre by
the Black Prince of the people of Limoges, men, women, and children,
more than three thousand. And when Edward III, before him, intended, as
would seem, to have treated the town of Calais in like manner, not only
did the French knights who had offered to surrender declare that they
would 'endure as much pain as knights ever did, rather than the poorest
lad in the town should have any more evil than the greatest of us
all'--showing that they made no selfish distinction between the noble
and the villain--but the English knights, headed by Sir Walter of
Manny, that flower of knighthood, protested to the utmost against their
king's purpose. And when he had yielded so far to their urgency as to
say that he would be content with the lives of the six chief burgesses,
Sir Walter of Manny again remonstrated, saying, 'Ah, noble king, for
God's sake refrain your courage: ye have the name of sovereign
noblesse: therefore now do not a thing that should blemish your renown,
nor to give cause to some to speak of you villainy [to charge you with
conduct unworthy of a knight and gentleman]; every man will say it is a
great cruelty to put to death such honest persons, who by their own
wills put themselves into your grace to save their company. Then the
king wryed away from him, and commanded to send for the hangman, and
said, “They of Calais had caused many of my men to be slain, wherefore
these shall die in likewise.”'

It needed a stronger influence than that of Sir Walter of Manny to save
their lives: and this brings me to speak of the LADY of the mediæval
times; the LADY, who was the counterpart of the KNIGHT, and without
whom he could never have existed. Here, indeed, I meet a difficulty
which reminds me of what Coleridge says of the female characters of
Shakspeare, that their truth to nature, and therefore their beauty,
consists in the absence of strongly marked features. It is impossible
to read the poems, romances, or chronicles of the mediæval times,
without feeling all through how important a part the lady plays
everywhere; and yet it is far from easy to draw her from her retirement
and bring distinctly before ourselves what she did, and get a picture
of her as definite as we can do of the knight. Still I must try to
trace the outlines of such a picture of one lady:--Philippa, queen of
Edward III, whom Froissart calls 'the most gentle queen, most liberal,
and most courteous that ever was queen in her days;' and who was the
very type and representative of the lady, in the highest and best
sense, in an age in which the ladies--such as the princess Blanche, the
good queen Ann, the countess of Salisbury, Jane de Montfort, and the
wife of Charles de Blois--were renowned for their gentle or their
heroic characters.

When Isabel, queen of Edward II, visited Hainault with her son,
afterwards Edward III, we are told that William, earl of Hainault, 'had
four fair daughters, Margaret, Philippa, Jane, and Isabel: among whom
the young Edward set most his love and company on Philippa; and also
the young lady in all honour was more conversant with him than any of
her sisters.' Queen Isabel had come to ask for aid against her enemies,
and Froissart gives an account of the discussion between the earl and
his council, who objected on prudential grounds to interfering with the
quarrels of the English, and the earl's brother, Sir John Hainault, who
maintained that 'all knights ought to aid to their powers all ladies
and damsels chased out of their own countries, being without counsel or
comfort.' The earl finally yielded, saying, 'My fair brother, God
forbid that your good purpose should be broken or let. Therefore, in
the name of God, I give you leave; and kissed him, straining him by the
hand in sign of great love.' The whole passage is too long to quote,
but thus much gives a lively picture of the temper of the home and
court in which the young Philippa was brought up.

Her marriage with Edward, then only fifteen years old, was agreed on,
and sanctioned by the Pope. I am sorry to say that the chronicler gives
no account of the lady's bridal outfit[45], except in the general
terms, that 'there was devised and purveyed for their apparel, and for
all things honourable that belonged to such a lady, who should be queen
of England.' They were married, and she arrived in England and was
crowned, 'with great justs, tourneys, dancing, carolling, and great
feasts, the which endured the space of three weeks.' And then 'this
young queen Philippa abode still in England, with small company of any
persons of her own country, saving one who was named Walter of Manny,
who was her carver, and after did so many great prowesses in divers
places, that it were hard to make mention of them.' If we couple this
statement, that she retained hardly any of her own people, with that
which Froissart makes in reviewing her whole life, that 'she loved
always her own nation where she was born,' we have pleasing thoughts
suggested of the cheerful acceptance of new duties in a foreign land by
the young wife; while, if I had space to describe in detail the noble
life of Sir Walter of Manny, the reader would agree with me that his
habitual presence in the English court must have done much to make both
Edward and the Black Prince, as well as the rest of the princes and
nobles, what they were, as knights and gentlemen.

The next glimpse we get of the queen is when she appears, accompanied
with three hundred ladies and damsels 'of noble lineage, and apparelled
accordingly, at the yearly feast at Windsor, in honour of the order and
brotherhood of the Knights of the Blue Garter, there established on St.
George's day.' Again, when the king of Scots had advanced to Newcastle,
while king Edward lay before Calais, we see the queen arriving to meet
the English army, and going from division to division, 'desiring them
to do their devoir'--duty was then, as now, the English soldier's
word--'to defend the honour of her lord the king of England, and, in
the name of God, every man to be of good heart and courage; promising
them that to her power she would remember them as well or better as
though her lord the king were there personally. Then the queen departed
from them, recommending them to God and St. George.' She does not seem,
like some of the ladies of that generation, to have considered the
field to be her place while the battle was going on; but after it was
won she returned, and with her council made all necessary arrangements
and plans. Shortly after she joined her husband while he lay before
Calais, 'bringing many ladies and damsels with her, as well to
accompany her, as to see their husbands, fathers, brethren, and other
friends that lay at siege there before Calais, and had done a long
time.' And I think we may attribute it as well to the general
humanising influence of all those ladies, as to the personal persuasion
of Philippa, that Calais did not suffer the same horrors of war as did
Limoges at the hands of the Black Prince. To what I have already quoted
from Froissart as to this story, I must now add what he tells us of
Philippa, after Edward had refused to hear Sir Walter of Manny. 'Then
the queen kneeled down, and sore weeping, said, “Ah, gentle sir, sith I
passed the sea in great peril, I have desired nothing of you; therefore
now I humbly require you, in the honour of the Son of the Virgin Mary,
and for the love of me, that ye will take mercy of these six
burgesses.” The king beheld the queen, and stood still in a study a
space, and then said, “Ah dame, I would ye had been as now in some
other place; ye make such request to me that I cannot deny you;
wherefore I give them to you, to do your pleasure with them.”'

And lastly, as a counterpart to the picture I have already given of the
death of the knight of romance, here is the account of the death of her
who was the lady of the brightest day of historical chivalry:--

'In the mean season there fell in England a heavy case and a common:
howbeit it was right piteous for the king, his children, and all his
realm; for the good queen of England--that so many good deeds had done
in her time, and so many knights succoured, and ladies and damosels
comforted, and had so largely departed of her goods to her people, and
naturally loved always the nation of Haynault, the country where she
was born--she fell sick in the castle of Windsor, the which sickness
continued on her so long, that there was no remedy but death; and the
good lady, when she knew that there was no remedy but death, she
desired to speak with the king her husband, and when he was before her,
she put out of her bed her right hand, and took the king by his right
hand, who was right sorrowful at his heart. Then she said, “Sir, we
have in peace, joy, and great prosperity, used all our time together:
sir, now I pray you at our departing, that ye will grant me three
desires.” The king, right sorrowfully weeping, said, “Madam, desire
what ye will, I grant it.” The three requests of the dying woman
were--that the king should pay all that she owed to any man; that he
should fulfil all the promises she had made to the churches where she
had “had her devotion,” and that “it might please him to take none
other sepulture, whensoever it should please God to call him out of
this transitory life, but beside her in Westminster.” The king, all
weeping, said, “Madam, I grant all your desire.” Then the good lady and
queen made on her the sign of the cross, and commended the king her
husband to God, and her youngest son Thomas, who was there beside her;
and anon after she yielded up the spirit, which I believe surely the
holy angels received with great joy up to heaven; for in all her life
she did neither in thought nor deed thing to lose her soul, as far as
any creature could know. Thus the good queen of England died in the
year of our Lord 1369, in the vigil of our Lady, in the midst of
August.'

We have all pictured to ourselves, again and again, how the lady sat in
her bower with her embroidery and her missal or romance, and saw from
her lattice window her knight going from the castle with lance and
pennon, hoping to meet his foe: how the minstrel recited in the castle
hall the feats of arms of this or that hero in some distant
battle-field; and how the matron or the maiden heard those feats, and
thought with silent joy that it was her lord, her husband, or her
lover, whose deeds were thus winning the praises of the troubadour, and
the applause of the listening knights and squires. We have all seen in
imagination the tournament, with the pomp and splendour of its mimic
contests: contests which surpassed the Olympic and Corinthian games of
classic antiquity, not only in their gorgeous show, but still more in
the presence of the ladies, noble in birth, and fame, and beauty; whose
scarf, or glove, the combatants wore as the token of that favour which
was their highest incentive to distinguish themselves; and from whose
hands the conqueror received the prize of skill and bravery: while the
honourably vanquished might be sure that he would have the hardly less
welcome lot of being cared for by the same ladies, who never shrank
from this their acknowledged and well-fulfilled duty of tending the
wounded knight.

Perhaps too we have listened in fancy to the proceedings of the
so-called Courts of Parliaments of Love, in which the ladies were wont
to hear questions of gallantry gravely argued on both sides by poets
pleading in verse, and then to give their judgments according to the
logical and metaphysical rules which the schoolmen applied to
theological enquiries. But I can now but remind my reader that such
things were; and must hasten forward, leaving ungathered flowers that
would make many a wreath and nosegay.

The golden age of chivalry was the period from about the middle of the
eleventh to the end of the fourteenth century. We may say with Gibbon,
that the Crusades were at once a cause and an effect of chivalry. In
the Crusades the spirit of knighthood, with all its characteristic
features, actuated vast bodies of men of every rank and nation, and
found a foe believed by all Christendom to be to it what the individual
robber and plunderer was to the knight errant who went forth in his own
country to defend or rescue the widow and orphan and their possessions,
or the traveller along the road which passed the castle of some
powerful though unworthy baron. The chivalry at home was kept alive,
and raised to its highest energy, both in man and woman, by the
chivalry in the Holy Land. It is in this period that the chief
institutions of chivalry took their rise, or reached their full form;
while their ruder features were gradually softened with the increasing
refinement of the times, till they presented that aspect with which we
find them in the days of Edward III and the Black Prince, as drawn by
Froissart or Chaucer, or in the romances which were then written or
remodelled out of older materials, and which show that even in the
estimation of other nations the English court then afforded the pattern
of knighthood for Christendom.

Thenceforward the outward forms of chivalry began to decay; very
gradually indeed, and not without apparent resuscitations from time to
time. But no real revival was possible; for the immortal spirit was
seeking new habitations for itself, more fitted to the new world which
was succeeding to that of the Middle Ages. And perhaps Cervantes, by
helping to tear up with his merciless satire the last remnants of an
honest faith in the old forms of chivalry, did as real, though we
cannot say as genial, a service to the cause of chivalry itself, as
Spenser did in endeavouring to preserve its spirit by transferring it
to the region of allegory. The last expiring token of the old spirit in
the old forms which I have found, is in the records of the Knights of
Malta--the Knights Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem--when the news
of the great earthquake in Sicily, in 1783, arrived at Malta. Then
those poor feeble-minded sybarites remembered for a moment their
manhood and their knighthood, and their vows as Hospitallers; they
manned their galleys, and, with food and clothing and medicines, and
the consolations of their faith, were speedily seen, in their
half-military, half-priestly garb--the armour covered by the black robe
with the white cross--at the bedsides of the wounded and the dying, as
they lay amid the still tottering ruins of their devastated houses. In
a very few years, in that same generation, the Order had passed away
for ever; but it is pleasant to him who stands in the palace of the
Grand Masters among the trophies of their former greatness, or treads
the aisles of the cathedral of St. John, where every step is upon the
emblazoned gravestone of a knight, to think of this, and not of any
less worthy deed, as their last act.

> 'The knight's bones are dust,
> And his good sword rust:
> His soul is with the saints, I trust:'--

but he has left to us an imperishable and a rich inheritance, won for
us by him. To him we owe our MANNERS--all that world of existence
implied in the names LADY and GENTLEMAN. Through the Middle Ages it was
'Our Lady,' the Virgin mother who embodied and represented to all men
and women, from the prince to the peasant, their ideals of womanhood
and ladyhood. In modern times St. Paul has been held to be the model of
a gentleman; in whose acts and writings are found all the principles,
maxims, and spirit of a character entirely chivalrous, in the amplest
sense of the term: while one of our old dramatists has ventured, in
words of touching tenderness and reverence, to point to a yet higher
realisation of that ideal;--

> 'The best of men
> That e'er wore earth about him, was a sufferer,
> A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit;
> The first true gentleman that ever breathed.'

And it was the transference of these Christian ethics, into the
practice of common daily, worldly life, in rude, half-barbarous times,
which we owe to the knights and ladies of the Middle Ages; a
transference effected slowly, and with much mixture of evil with the
good: nor is the work nearly completed yet; but the worth of it can
hardly be overrated.

This is not indeed all, but there is much truth in the old motto,
'Manners makyth man.' Manners, like laws, create a region and
atmosphere of virtue within which all good more easily lives and grows,
and evil finds it harder to maintain itself. How large a portion of the
small, spontaneous kindnesses of hourly life, in which, after all, so
much of our happiness consists, are not only unknown, but impossible,
where habitual, unaffected politeness is wanting.

But manners are good, not only as affording a fairer field for the
exercise of the higher virtues, but good in themselves. They are a real
part of the beauty and grace of our human life. Courtesy, and
self-possession, and deference and respect for others; modesty and
gentleness towards all men, and recognition in all of the true gold of
humanity, whether it bear the guinea stamp or no; love of truth and
honour; and not only readiness, but eagerness to help the weak, and
defend their cause against the strong; and all these irradiated and
glorified, as often as may be, by that sentiment which

> '----gives to every power a double power,
> Above their functions and their offices;'--

these are the things which make the lady and the gentleman.

And if it should seem as though the chivalry of our own times is
reduced to something less noble than that of old, when men risked life,
and things dearer than life, in defending the weak and attacking the
oppressor in his strongholds--when the hardness of the actual fight
against evil-doers was not exaggerated in the romances which pictured
the knights contending with dragons and enchanters and giants--we must
remember that our nineteenth century world is yet far from cleared of
the monstrous powers of evil, which still oppress and devour the weak;
and that a battle, not really less resolute, nor, if need be, less
desperate, than those of old, is still carried on by those who, under
the modest guise of common life, are fighting in the true spirit of
chivalry--uniting the most adventurous enthusiasm with the most patient
endurance, and both with the gentlest service of the poor, the weak,
and the oppressed; and, what is most worthy of admiration, the service
of the morally poor, and weak, and oppressed, who, but for such
deliverers, must remain in a house of bondage darker than can be built
or barred by earthly hands.

But whether we are content with the chivalry of manners, or aspire to a
place in the brotherhood of the chivalry of action, our principles, our
maxims, and our examples have come down to us as an inheritance from
the past:--an inheritance common to all who care to claim it; and won
for us by the old knights, fighting in the name of God and of their
ladies[46].


THE BOOK OF KING ARTHUR AND OF HIS NOBLE KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE.
====================================================================

PREFACE OF WILLIAM CAXTON.
--------------------------

After that I had accomplished and finished divers histories, as well of
contemplation as of other historial and worldly acts of great
conquerors and princes, and also certain books of ensamples and
doctrine, many noble and divers gentlemen of this realm of England came
and demanded me many and ofttimes, wherefore that I have not do made
and imprint the noble history of the Saint Greal, and of the most
renowned Christian king, first and chief of the three best Christian,
and worthy, king Arthur, which ought most to be remembered amongst us
Englishmen tofore all other Christian kings; for it is notoriously
known through the universal world, that there be nine worthy and the
best that ever were, that is to wit, three Paynims, three Jews, and
three Christian men. As for the Paynims, they were tofore the
Incarnation of Christ, which were named, the first Hector of Troy, of
whom the history is comen both in ballad and in prose, the second
Alexander the Great, and the third Julius Cæsar, Emperor of Rome, of
whom the histories be well known and had. And as for the three Jews,
which also were tofore the incarnation of our Lord, of whom the first
was duke Joshua which brought the children of Israel into the land of
behest, the second David king of Jerusalem, and the third Judas
Machabeus. Of these three the Bible rehearseth all their noble
histories and acts. And since the said incarnation have been three
noble Christian men, stalled and admitted through the universal world
into the number of the nine best and worthy. Of whom was first the
noble Arthur, whose noble acts I purpose to write in this present book
here following. The second was Charlemain, or Charles the Great, of
whom the history is had in many places, both in French and in English.
And the third and last was Godfrey of Boloine, of whose acts and life I
made a book unto the excellent prince and king of noble memory, king
Edward the Fourth. The said noble gentlemen instantly required me to
imprint the history of the said noble king and conqueror king Arthur,
and of his knights, with the history of the Saint Greal, and of the
death and ending of the said Arthur; affirming that I ought rather to
imprint his acts and noble feats, than of Godfrey of Boloine, or any of
the other eight, considering that he was a man born within this realm,
and king and emperor of the same: and that there be in French divers
and many noble volumes of his acts, and also of his knights. To whom I
answered that divers men hold opinion that there was no such Arthur,
and that all such books as been made of him, be but feigned and fables,
because that some chronicles make of him no mention, nor remember him
nothing, nor of his knights. Whereto they answered, and one in special
said, that in him that should say or think that there was never such a
king called Arthur, might well be aretted great folly and blindness.
For he said that there were many evidences of the contrary. First ye
may see his sepulchre in the monastery of Glastingbury. And also in
Policronicon, in the fifth book the sixth chapter, and in the seventh
book the twenty-third chapter, where his body was buried, and after
found, and translated into the said monastery. Ye shall see also in the
history of Bochas in his book _De Casu Principum_ part of his noble
acts, and also of his fall. Also Galfridus in his British book
recounteth his life: and in divers places of England many remembrances
be yet of him, and shall remain perpetually, and also of his knights.
First in the abbey of Westminster, at St. Edward's shrine, remaineth
the print of his seal in red wax closed in beryl, in which is written,
_Patricius Arthurus Britannie, Gallie, Germanie, Dacie, Imperator_.
Item in the castle of Dover ye may see Gawaine's scull, and Cradok's
mantle: at Winchester the Round Table: in other places Launcelot's
sword and many other things. Then all these things considered, there
can no man reasonably gainsay but that there was a king of this land
named Arthur. For in all places, Christian and heathen, he is reputed
and taken for one of the nine worthy, and the first of the three
Christian men. And also, he is more spoken of beyond the sea, more
books made of his noble acts, than there be in England, as well in
Dutch, Italian, Spanish, and Greekish, as in French. And yet of record
remain in witness of him in Wales, in the town of Camelot, the great
stones and the marvellous works of iron lying under the ground, and
royal vaults, which divers now living have seen. Wherefore it is a
marvel why he is no more renowned in his own country, save only it
accordeth to the Word of God, which saith that no man is accepted for a
prophet in his own country. Then all these things aforesaid alleged, I
could not well deny but that there was such a noble king named Arthur,
and reputed one of the nine worthy, and first and chief of the
Christian men. And many noble volumes be made of him and of his noble
knights in French, which I have seen and read beyond the sea, which be
not had in our maternal tongue. But in Welsh be many and also in
French, and some in English but no where nigh all. Wherefore, such as
have late been drawn out briefly into English I have after the simple
conning that God hath sent to me, under the favour and correction of
all noble lords and gentlemen, enprised to imprint a book of the noble
histories of the said king Arthur, and of certain of his knights, after
a copy unto me delivered, which copy Sir Thomas Malorye did take out of
certain books of French, and reduced it into English. And I, according
to my copy, have down set it in print, to the intent that noble men may
see and learn the noble acts of chivalry, the gentle and virtuous deeds
that some knights used in those days, by which they came to honour, and
how they that were vicious were punished and oft put to shame and
rebuke; humbly beseeching all noble lords and ladies, with all other
estates of what estate or degree they been of, that shall see and read
in this said book and work, that they take the good and honest acts in
their remembrance, and to follow the same. Wherein they shall find many
joyous and pleasant histories, and noble and renowned acts of humanity,
gentleness, and chivalry. For herein may be seen noble chivalry,
courtesy, humanity, friendliness, hardiness, love, friendship,
cowardice, murder, hate, virtue, and sin. Do after the good and leave
the evil, and it shall bring you to good fame and renommee. And for to
pass the time this book shall be pleasant to read in, but for to give
faith and belief that all is true that is contained herein, ye be at
your liberty: but all is written for our doctrine, and for to beware
that we fall not to vice nor sin, but to exercise and follow virtue, by
the which we may come and attain to good fame and renown in this life,
and after this short and transitory life to come unto everlasting bliss
in heaven; the which He grant us that reigneth in heaven, the blessed
Trinity. Amen.

Then to proceed forth in this said book, the which I direct unto all
noble princes, lords and ladies, gentlemen or gentlewomen, that desire
to read or hear read of the noble and joyous history of the great
conqueror and excellent king, King Arthur, sometime king of this noble
realm, then called Britain; I, William Caxton, simple person, present
this book following, which I have enprised to imprint: and treateth of
the noble acts, feats of arms of chivalry, prowess, hardiness,
humanity, love, courtesy, and very gentleness, with many wonderful
histories and adventures. And for to understand briefly the content of
this volume, I have divided it into XXI Books, and every book
