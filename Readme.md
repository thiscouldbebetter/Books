Books
=====

Contained within this repository are books that are either in the public domain or whose copyright belongs to This Could Be Better.  Those books in the public domain can be freely copied, distributed and modified without restriction.

Some books with larger file sizes, usually those containing many images, have been split off from this repository into their own repositories, and then re-added as Git submodules.  This is intended to reduce the size of this parent repository, and thus to make both the parent and child repositories easier to work with.  The submodules for these books can be downloaded either after the initial clone by running the command "git submodule update --init ." from within their respective empty directories, or along with the main body of the parent repository by including the "--recursive" switch as part of the original "git clone" command.
